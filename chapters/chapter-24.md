Title: "Chapter 24 – The Tea on the Table"
---

The steam rose gently from the cups, fragrant with cardamom and milk. The man’s polite smile never wavered as he set the tray down, sliding one porcelain cup toward each of them.

Ramirez sniffed hers suspiciously, holding it up at arm’s length. “Oh sure, this looks harmless. Cute little teacups, sugar on the side, no skulls floating in it. Totally not poison.” She leaned toward the ceiling. “You hear that, writer? This is *so* your style. Slip me cyanide in a chai latte, just to watch me squirm. Real classy.”

Zureenab laughed under her breath, shaking her head. “You’re impossible.”

Ramirez grinned. “And alive. Let’s keep it that way.” She set the cup back with exaggerated care, pushing it across the table like it was a live grenade. “No offense, old man, but if I keel over mid-sip, I am *haunting* this bungalow.”

The man chuckled softly. “You have quite the imagination, miss. Please, drink. It is only tea.”

Rahim didn’t touch his cup. He was scanning the room instead, his detective’s eye catching on details most people would miss. A frame on the wall hung at a perfect angle, not a millimeter off. The rug beneath the table was immaculate, no sign of dust even near the edges. The stack of books on the shelf looked carefully arranged, their spines facing outward in a neat, unread line.

It was too perfect. Too polished.

Like someone had dressed the set for them.

Zayra shifted uneasily. “Rahim?” she murmured.

He leaned back slightly, voice low. “This place doesn’t live. It performs.”

Tariq frowned. “What do you mean?”

Rahim’s gaze lingered on the smiling host, who hadn’t blinked in too long. “I mean this isn’t a home. It’s a stage. Someone wanted us to feel at ease.”

Ramirez leaned forward, cupping her chin theatrically. “Ooooh, spooky. Like we’ve walked into the world’s politest trap.” She poked her teacup again and muttered, “Yeah, still not drinking it.”

Zureenab looked at the man carefully now, her smile fading. “If this is a stage… where’s the actor hiding?”

"You forgot babes... We are characters. We are also acting." Ramirez taunts her.

The man only smiled wider, folding his hands behind his back.

And the steam kept curling upward, ghostlike, refusing to dissipate.
