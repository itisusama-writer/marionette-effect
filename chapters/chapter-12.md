Title: "Chapter 12 - Threads in the Dark"
---

The operations room was quieter now, but the tension clung to the air. The clock on the wall ticked past 11 p.m., and the only light came from the blue glow of the monitors.

Ramirez sat with her boots up on the desk, flipping through digital files faster than Rahim or Tariq could follow. Names, timestamps, incident locations they scrolled across her screen in a rapid blur.

“Okay,” she said, finally lowering her feet. “These collapses? They’re not random. Someone’s tracking their movement *and* their heart rates in real-time. The ankle bracelets aren’t just ornaments they’re biometric cages.”

Rahim crossed his arms. “You’re saying someone is... watching them? Right now?”

“Not just watching. Controlling,” Ramirez replied, tapping a map. “Look, Lena, Mariam, Aida, Hira... every time one of them comes within a certain range of a location... bam. Shutdown signal.”

Tariq leaned in, frowning. “So, they’re programmed to fall if they cross a certain line? That’s... twisted.”

“Yeah, well,” Ramirez muttered under her breath, *“twisted’s basically the writer’s favorite genre.”*

Rahim’s brow furrowed. “Sorry, what was that?”

“Nothing,” she said quickly, flashing an innocent smile. “Just talking to myself. I do that when I’m bored.”

Before Rahim could press further, an alert pinged on the main console. One of the trackers lit up red, then green, then static.

Tariq’s eyes widened. “Uh... that’s not supposed to happen.”

Ramirez leaned forward, her smirk fading. “No, it’s not. Someone’s noticed we’re sniffing around.”

Across the city, in a bunglow filled with the quiet hum of expensive electronics, the rich man behind the bracelets sat at his desk. One monitor showed his girls moving through the streets like shadows. Another displayed an active map of police digital probes.

He reached over, flipped a switch, and spoke into a headset. “Our guests are trying to peek behind the curtain. Let’s make sure they know they’re not welcome.”

Within seconds, the operations room’s screens glitched. Data streams warped. The map scrambled itself into nonsense.

“Son of a...” Ramirez hissed, fingers flying over the keyboard. “He’s throwing us out of his system.”

Rahim glanced at her. “Can you stop him?”

Ramirez leaned closer to the console and whispered to herself, “If you know this writer, I can’t do this bullshit tech stuff. You should’ve sent Zureenab.”

The next instant, her pupils dilated sharply. Her breathing steadied. Her fingers stopped mid-motion. Then resumed with lightning speed, moving across the keyboard like the commands were hardwired into her muscles.

It wasn’t Ramirez’s style anymore.
It was Zureenab’s.

Her body remained in the chair, but her mind had shifted Zureenab was in control, operating through her.

The chaotic streams of code began to align. The scrambled maps reformed. Within seconds, the police systems were not only stable, but enhanced and running faster, sharper, and more secure than before.

Across the city, the rich man froze in front of his monitors. The glitching stopped but now, his feeds were being mirrored. Someone on the other side was watching *him*.

“No... no, no...” he muttered, leaning forward. “That’s impossible.”

Then the mirrored feed zoomed in on his own face.

He slammed his fist on the desk. “WHO THE HELL IS THIS?!”

Back in the operations room, Zureenab, still in Ramirez’s body allowed herself a tiny smirk. “Game on,” she murmured.

Her fingers tapped one last string of code, locking the system with an encryption key only she knew. The feeds stabilized completely, and the antagonist’s access was cut off.

Then she leaned back, exhaled, and muttered, “Alright... your turn, Ramirez.”

Her eyes fluttered shut for a fraction of a second. When they opened again, the sharp precision in her gaze was gone replaced by Ramirez’s usual spark of chaos.

Ramirez blinked, looked down at her hands, and muttered, “...What the hell just happened?”

Rahim and Tariq exchanged confused glances, as if they’d just watched someone switch channels in the middle of a live broadcast.
