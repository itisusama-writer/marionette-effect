Title: "Chapter 5 - The Parcel"
---

The four of them stood frozen in the dim light of the convenience store’s parking lot, the small brown parcel lying between them like a live explosive. The countdown still glowed in red on their phones. Two minutes left.

Lena was the first to move. “We have to open it,” she hissed, glancing over her shoulder.

“No,” Mariam snapped, “he said pick it up, not open it.”

The bands on their ankles buzzed long, slow pulses that made their legs feel heavy. Aida bent down and grabbed one side. The others followed instinctively, lifting it together. The moment it left the ground, the buzzing stopped.

The voice crackled back into their ears, almost casual.
“Good. Now walk. Left, three blocks. There’s a bench. Leave it there.”

They exchanged looks, fear tightening their faces. Hira tried to speak, but the bands buzzed again, sharper this time, cutting her off. So they walked, four strangers bound by the same silent terror.

It wasn’t until they turned the last corner that they saw the problem.

Two police cruisers were parked near the bench, their lights off but engines running. Two officers stood nearby, drinking coffee, watching the empty street.

“Oh my God,” Lena whispered.

“They’ll think it’s ours,” Aida muttered, gripping the parcel tighter.

The countdown ticked under five minutes now. They could hear their own breathing, ragged and uneven.

“What do we do?” Mariam’s voice cracked.

The voice returned, almost mocking this time.
“You’ll leave it. You’ll walk away. If they stop you, you’ll smile and tell them nothing. You’ll do it, because the alternative is... unpleasant.”

The bands buzzed harder, a warning.

They crossed the street. The officers noticed them now, one of them frowning, his gaze dropping to the box in their hands.

“Evening,” he called out. “What’s that you’ve got there?”

The girls didn’t answer. Aida placed the parcel on the bench, her hands trembling. The four turned to leave.

“Hold up,” the officer said, taking a step forward.

The buzzing became a sharp, electric stab. Lena bit her lip to keep from crying out.

“Walk,” the voice ordered.

And they did. Past the police, past the glow of the convenience store, down the empty street. None of them dared to look back.

Behind them, one officer bent to open the box. The other watched the girls vanish into the dark. When the parcel was opened, the contents made his expression shift instantly from curiosity to unease.

A small black device, blinking steadily, sat on top of a stack of crisp, bound cash. And taped inside the lid was a photograph grainy, but clear enough to show four female silhouettes walking away from the camera.
