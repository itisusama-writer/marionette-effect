Title: "Chapter 1 - Introduction"
---

The city lights of IndoPak shimmered across the wet asphalt, throwing streaks of gold and blue into the night. A deep purr of an imported engine cut through the quiet as a black Maybach eased into the long driveway of a sprawling bungalow. The high gates closed behind it with a slow, deliberate hum.

Inside, the car’s interior smelled faintly of leather and cedar polish. The man in the driver’s seat, immaculately dressed in a dark suit, loosened his tie with one hand as the automatic garage door sealed them from the world outside. His face was calm, expressionless, the face of someone used to having doors open before him and problems vanish when he wanted them gone.

He stepped out, polished shoes clicking against the marble floor. A housekeeper appeared at the far end of the garage, bowing her head slightly.

“Welcome home, sir.”

He gave a polite nod but didn’t answer. The house seemed to breathe around him, its warm lighting and silent hallways wrapping him in a cocoon of wealth.

From the side entrance, three men in black jackets emerged from the shadows. The same men who, an hour earlier, had stepped out of a nondescript sedan on a quiet street.

The one in front spoke, his voice low but carrying enough weight to draw the man’s full attention.
“Boss, those girls… Lena and Mariam. We marked them.”

The man’s fingers brushed his cufflinks, straightening them with an absent precision. “Good,” he said. “Two down.” His tone was smooth, almost casual, but his eyes sharpened. “We still have two more.”

“Yes, sir. We’re tracking them now.”

He started walking toward the main corridor, his footsteps slow, unhurried. “Don’t take too long. The clock is already ticking.”

The men nodded. One of them glanced toward the polished wooden staircase at the end of the hall, but the man never looked back. His mind was already moving ahead, calculating.

Upstairs, a floor-to-ceiling window framed the city skyline, and in its glass reflection, he allowed himself the faintest hint of a smile.
