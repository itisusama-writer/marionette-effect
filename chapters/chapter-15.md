Title: "Chapter 15 - Pieces on the Board"

**Underground Facility – Night**

The rich man’s private chamber glowed with the hum of servers. Code danced across his screens in jagged green lines, his fingers tapping rhythmically as if he were conducting an orchestra no one else could hear.

On the other side of a one-way glass wall, **Lena, Mariam, Aida, and Hira** stood silently. Their eyes were wide open, but empty. Their posture relaxed, almost delicate, yet their bangled ankles pulsed in eerie synchronization, tiny blue sparks running through the metal like veins of fire.

The man leaned closer to the glass, smiling faintly.

“You four are not just soldiers,” he whispered. “You are signals. Noise. Bait.”

He tapped a command. On one of the screens, a schematic appeared—an intricate network of signals branching across the city. At the heart of it was an overlay the police had intercepted earlier. He chuckled softly.

“They think they cracked my cage. They think they understand the bracelets.”

He pointed to the girls.

“But what they have… is version one. Outdated. Disposable. What I hold now” his smile widened, “... Is evolution.”

The bracelets on the girls’ ankles glowed brighter. Their breathing slowed, then matched each other’s perfectly, a single rhythm drawn from a single source.

The man turned away, satisfied. “Let’s see if Rahim and his new guest survive round two.”

**Operations Room – Police HQ**

Screens blinked alive with fresh data. Rahim leaned over the console, Tariq beside him, Ramirez sprawled in her usual half-slouch, boots tapping against the desk.

“Okay, good news,” Tariq announced, scrolling through reports. “The collapse triggers... They’re inactive now. The bracelets we studied? Shut down. No new spikes in the last twenty-four hours.”

Rahim exhaled slowly, relief softening his shoulders. “Finally. Some breathing room.”

Ramirez tilted her head, squinting at the screen. “Or...” she dragged the word out, “...it’s the part in the horror movie where the killer pretends to be dead before jumping out with a chainsaw.”

Tariq blinked. “Do you always...”

“Yes,” she cut him off, smirking.

Before Rahim could intervene, the door opened again. Zayra walked in, her laptop already under her arm, eyes sharp and focused.

Rahim gave her a brief nod of acknowledgment. “Back so soon?”

“Didn’t leave,” Zayra replied evenly, sliding into a chair. “I’ve been running sweeps from the side room. And you’re not going to like what I found.”

She placed her laptop down like a blade being unsheathed, the screen flashing to life with cascading code. Cyber defense and system forensics. Your problem isn’t solved it’s just shifted.”

Ramirez raised a brow, leaning back in her chair. “Back again with that ‘I know everything’ face, huh? Great, just what this circus needed another genius who actually knows what she’s doing.”

Zayra froze, confused for a second. “...Excuse me?”

Rahim sighed. “Don’t mind her. She does that.”

Ramirez grinned, unbothered.

Zayra adjusted her glasses, focusing back on her code. “The system you cracked yesterday? It was a decoy. A fake shell to keep you busy. The bracelets you studied are not the ones active right now.”

Rahim’s relief vanished. “Then what are we dealing with?”

Zayra’s fingers flew across the keyboard, a map blooming on-screen. Four red dots pulsed in sync.

“Version two,” she said flatly. “More advanced. Stronger encryption. And.”

The map zoomed in on a live feed: **Lena, Mariam, Aida, and Hira** walking through a deserted street in perfect unison.

Zayra’s jaw tightened. “—he’s already using them as pawns.”

Ramirez’s smirk faded for once. She leaned forward, muttering under her breath. “And the writer just can’t help himself. Bangles, bracelets, chains it’s always some twisted jewelry collection.”

Rahim ignored her this time. His voice was grim. “Then it’s not just about stopping the control. It’s about saving the girls before he burns them out completely.”

The room fell silent except for the hum of machines.

The board had been set.
The pieces were moving.
And the game had only just begun.
