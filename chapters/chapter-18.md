Title: "Chapter 18 - Pieces on the Board"

The operations room buzzed with static. Lines of code blurred, alarms pinged, and the false signal that Zayra had planted suddenly flared red.

Tariq’s hands flew over his keyboard. “Uh, guys? Something’s wrong. He didn’t just take the bait he hijacked it!”

Before Rahim could respond, the lights flickered. Then, the security feeds came alive with movement.

Four figures.

Lena. Mariam. Aida. Hira.

Their blank eyes glowed faintly in the camera haze, each one wearing the cursed ankle bracelets pulsing in sync. They moved like shadows cutting through the street outside HQ swift, mechanical, unstoppable.

“They’re here,” Zayra whispered.

A loud crash split the silence. A window shattered, shards scattering across the floor. Ramirez spun, instincts kicking in, her gun already drawn.

“Aw, hell no,” she barked. “Not again. Writer, I swear.”

The first to lunge through was Lena, her face pale, movements rigid as a puppet. She charged straight at Ramirez with frightening speed.

Ramirez blocked the hit, shoved her back, but another figure was already on her Mariam, fists swinging like pistons. Ramirez ducked one, caught another across the shoulder, and staggered.

“Goddammit, these kids hit harder than rookies on steroids!” she shouted, driving an elbow into Mariam’s side.

The girl didn’t flinch. Didn’t even blink.

Rahim and Tariq tried to hold the door as Aida and Hira pushed through, their blank stares fixed on the room.

Zayra snapped orders. “Don’t hurt them! They’re not in control!”

Ramirez snarled, tossing Mariam across the table. “Oh, I’ll control them, alright. With my fists!”

Zayra grabbed her arm mid-swing. “They are *young girls,* Ramirez! Are you serious?!”

For a split second, Ramirez froze, fist trembling in the air, eyes blazing with fury and confusion.

The girls advanced again, their bracelets glowing brighter, their bodies jerking like marionettes pulled too tight.

Rahim fired a warning shot into the ceiling. “We need to contain them, not kill them!”

“Contain them?!” Ramirez shouted, shoving Lena back against a wall. “They’re trying to rearrange my face, Detective!”

Zayra crouched by a console, her fingers flying. “I can jam the signal temporarily but I need thirty seconds!”

“Thirty seconds?” Ramirez grunted, ducking under a wild swing. “Lady, I don’t even think we have ten!”

The room was chaos metal clanging, furniture toppling, the sound of young voices grunting under a power that wasn’t their own.

And above it all, Ramirez’s voice roared:

“WHEN I FIND THAT RICH BASTARD I SWEAR I’M GONNA SHOVE HIS BRACELETS UP HIS”

“Ramirez!” Rahim cut her off again, pushing Hira away. “Focus!”

The fight raged on, every second dragging closer to collapse, as the girls innocent pawns in someone else’s game closed in.
