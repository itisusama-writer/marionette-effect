Title: "Chapter 17 - The Bait"
---

The operations room looked like someone had turned paranoia into a blueprint.

Screens glowed with maps, schematics, and scrolling lines of code. Wires ran across desks in messy tangles, the smell of burnt coffee clinging to the air. Rahim stood over the central display, his jaw set, his eyes heavy.

Zayra typed fast, a dozen windows opening and closing in quick succession. “Alright, if we want him to bite, we need to make it look sloppy. Just enough breadcrumbs to tempt him.”

Tariq glanced up. “Breadcrumbs?”

“Fake signals,” she explained. “Ghost activity. A pattern that screams *weak point,* but isn’t real.”

Ramirez leaned back in her chair, arms crossed, boots tapping on the table. “Translation: we’re catfishing a lunatic with ankle bracelets.”

Zayra smirked. “Pretty much.”

Rahim didn’t laugh. “And when he comes sniffing?”

“We catch him trying to catch us,” Zayra replied, fingers still flying.

Ramirez muttered under her breath, *“The writer really loves this crap. Jewelry guy. What’s next, cursed collars or earings?”*

Tariq shot her a confused look. “What?”

“Nothing,” Ramirez said quickly, flashing a fake smile. “Just making conversation.”

Rahim narrowed his eyes but didn’t press. Not here. Not now. Still, the way she said it like she was talking to someone *else* stuck with him. He tucked it away in silence, a private suspicion he wasn’t ready to share.

On the monitors, the fake signal pulsed alive.

Zayra sat back, satisfied. “There. Let’s see if he takes the bait.”

The room went still, waiting.

And somewhere in the city, a pair of eyes were already watching.

The fake signal blinked steady on the operations room screen, like a heartbeat waiting to be noticed.

Rahim folded his arms. “Now we wait.”

Ramirez sighed loudly. “Cool. Love waiting. Love being bait. This writer really spoils me.” She leaned back farther, chair creaking, muttering curses under her breath that Rahim pretended not to hear.

Zayra ignored her, eyes glued to the monitors. Tariq looked like he wanted to throw up.

And then...

**Elsewhere in the city.**

The rich man’s chamber hummed with cold machinery. Rows of monitors flickered in the darkness, his empire mapped out in glowing grids.

And then it appeared.

A new signal.

Pulsing. Vulnerable. Just begging to be touched.

His lips curled into a grin. “Ah... so they think they can dangle a thread in my web.”

He leaned forward, fingers brushing across his controls. For a moment, the light of the monitors cut sharp lines across his face, highlighting the hunger in his eyes.

“Sloppy. Too obvious. But tempting enough to taste.”

He tapped a key, sending a probe across the network. Lines of code rushed like hunting dogs, sniffing for weakness.

For the first time in hours, his blood thrilled. Someone had challenged him.

And if they wanted a game... he’d play.

He activated the command line, his voice low and deliberate.

“Deploy Lena. Mariam. Aida. Hira.”

On another screen, four dots lit up on the city grid. His girls his pieces.

“They think they’re hunters. Let’s remind them who built the cage.”

The monitors glowed brighter as the system responded, the air in the chamber vibrating faintly with signal echoes.

And somewhere, far away, the trap the police thought was theirs... had already become his.
