Title: "Chapter 8 – The First Thread"
---

Detective Rahim sat in the dim operations room, the hum of the surveillance monitors filling the silence. The footage from the city square was grainy but clear enough. Two women brushing past each other by the fountain, one in a red scarf, the other in a gray coat.

He hit pause, leaning forward.

“Same two women, different angles,” said his junior, Tariq, pointing to the next clip on the split screen. “Here, thirty seconds earlier, they both enter from opposite ends of the street. Their timing is too perfect.”

Rahim’s eyes narrowed. “And here, right after... they don’t even look back.”

He tapped the glass, marking both frames. “Run face match on the one in the red scarf. Start there. Find me everything.”

It was the first tangible connection. Two women moving like pieces on a board, coordinated but silent. And Rahim knew from experience that when coincidences lined up this neatly, someone was pulling the strings.

At 3:17 PM, all four girls received the same message.
*New task. Urgent. You have twenty minutes.*

This time, there was no subtle exchange in a crowded plaza. No harmless looking bag. The instructions were blunt.

*You will each enter the listed bank branch. At exactly 3:40 PM, trigger the fire alarm. Do not speak to staff. Do not take anything. Walk out.*

Lena stared at the message until the letters blurred. The bank was five blocks from her office. She could feel her pulse in the ankle device.

Aida’s mind spun. How was this still possible in broad daylight without being caught?

Mariam’s hand trembled as she pushed open the glass door to her assigned branch, trying not to meet the eyes of the security guard.

Hira’s breath came fast, shallow. Her branch was already busy with customers when she slipped inside.

At precisely 3:40, all four alarms wailed in unison in four different parts of the city.

Panic followed, staff shouting, customers rushing to the exits, sprinklers releasing cold sprays in two of the locations. The girls did exactly as told, walking out in the chaos, blending into the panicked crowds.

By 4:15, the news cycle was already lit with headlines: **“Coordinated Bank Alarms Across City. No Theft Reported.”**

The police were rattled. Why trigger alarms without a robbery? Why in multiple branches at once? And why were the security cameras, in three of the four cases, just out of focus or conveniently obstructed at the key moments?

In the dark study of his bungalow, the antagonist watched the footage with satisfaction. This was the beginning of public confusion, of law enforcement chasing smoke while he built the fire.

For the girls, though, the realization was colder. They weren’t just part of something strange anymore. They had now committed a public disruption, their faces possibly caught on multiple cameras, with no way to explain why.

And somewhere in a police database, two of them were now tagged together under a single case file.

The first thread had been found, and Rahim was going to pull.
