Title: "Chapter 11 - An Unwelcome Drop-In"

The police operations room buzzed with low voices and the hum of machines. Monitors flickered with CCTV feeds, biometric readouts, and endless maps of the city. Rahim leaned over Tariq’s shoulder, scanning the latest collapse reports.

“That’s the third time this week,” Tariq said, tapping the screen. “Two of them in broad daylight. Same pattern. Girls go unresponsive, vitals dip, then they just... come back.”

Before Rahim could answer, the air near the evidence table shimmered just for a fraction of a second and a figure landed with a thud on her boots.

“Fuck... not again, you writer,” Ramirez muttered, brushing herself off like she’d been thrown into the scene by an impatient hand. Her tone was somewhere between irritated and resigned.

Tariq blinked. “Uh... who—?”

Ramirez shot him a look. “Don’t ask. Trust me, your head will hurt.” She turned to Rahim, pointing at the files. “These girls Lena, Mariam, Aida, Hira. You’re dealing with a remote trigger system. Somebody’s got biometric control over them, and every time you poke the wrong nerve, boom, they drop.”

Rahim’s brows furrowed. “And you know this how?”

“Let’s just say I’ve seen it before,” Ramirez said, smirking without humor. “Different city, different year... same creepy control fetish.”

She slid into a chair, pulling one of the CCTV feeds toward her. “First step... Stop chasing them like criminals. Whoever’s behind this is using them as shields. You try to corner them, you’ll just trigger another collapse.”

Rahim studied her for a long moment. Something about her didn’t fit, her clothes, her presence, her blunt certainty, but right now, they didn’t have the luxury to question it.

“Fine,” he said finally. “You want in, you work with me and Tariq. But you follow my lead.”

Ramirez gave him a two finger salute. “Sure, Detective. Just remember when this gets ugly, it’s not me you need to worry about. It’s him.”

And in the high-rise bungalow across the city, the man at the console paused mid-sip of his drink. His monitors had just picked up a new variable in his game, a name he didn’t recognize.

He leaned forward, smiling faintly. “Ramirez... Let’s see how you play.”
