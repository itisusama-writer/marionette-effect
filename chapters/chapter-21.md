Title: "Chapter 21 – The Unwelcome Genius"

The air was still heavy with smoke residue when Zureenab dropped into a chair like she’d been here all along. She cracked her knuckles, pulled Tariq’s laptop toward her, and began typing so fast the keys blurred.

Rahim hovered, arms crossed, his frown cutting sharp lines into his face. “You can’t just appear out of nowhere and hijack our systems. Who even *are* you?”

Zureenab didn’t look up. “Already told you. Zureenab. Tech specialist. Imported courtesy of…” She waved vaguely at the ceiling. “Him.”

Ramirez raised her hand like she was seconding a motion in class. “Yep. She’s telling the truth. The writer has this fun little habit of stuffing people into my head like it’s a shared Uber ride. One time she literally drove my fingers like a rented keyboard. Creepy as hell, but effective.”

Rahim scowled. “So, another one of your… delusions?”

Zureenab smirked without pausing her typing. “Delusion? Honey, I practically wrote the code that slapped you in the face tonight.”

Ramirez leaned in, grinning. “She’s not kidding. The writer switches channels between us like it’s Netflix. One second I’m me, the next I’m her. It’s like Freaky Friday, but with more swearing.”

Zureenab stopped typing just long enough to point at Ramirez. “And bad aim.”

“Hey!” Ramirez gasped. “That slap from Lena was not my fault. That was the writer’s sick sense of humor.” She jabbed at the ceiling again. “You hear that, boss? Slapstick comedy is not character development!”

Zayra, still trying to keep up, folded her arms. “You two… are insane.”

Zureenab flashed her a quick smile. “Insane, yes. Useful, also yes.” She tapped a final key and spun the laptop around, the screen showing a chaotic but decipherable map of signals. “This is his system. Every bracelet ping, every pulse of control, mapped in real time.”

Tariq’s jaw dropped. “That’s… impossible. We’ve been trying to get in for days.”

“Because you’re playing chess,” Zureenab said casually. “I’m playing *writer-chess.* Different board, different rules.”

Ramirez clapped like a proud parent. “See? This is why I don’t strangle her. Occasionally, she’s brilliant.”

Rahim leaned closer, suspicious. “And what exactly are you planning to do with this?”

Zureenab locked eyes with him, her tone suddenly sharp. “We can hack his ankle bracelet control system. But here’s the problem—we don’t know how many bracelets he has. Could be four, could be forty.”

Rahim’s face darkened.

She softened, glancing at Zayra now. “But we can try something else. We build our own system. One that interferes with his. Jam the signals, rewrite the commands, maybe even give the girls a few seconds of free will.”

Her fingers danced over the keys again, blueprints forming on screen. “It would be easier. And I know…” She hesitated, then corrected herself with conviction. “No. I *believe* this will work.”

Zayra leaned over the screen, her analytical calm sharpening. “If you’re right, we wouldn’t just be reacting to him anymore. We’d be playing offense.”

Rahim shook his head slowly. “This all feels too… convenient. You fall out of nowhere, claim to know how to do what my entire department can’t, and expect me to just let you?”

Ramirez threw her arms wide. “Detective, please. We’re way past convenient. Did you miss the part where smoke bombs and puppet-girls trashed your HQ? At this point, either you trust her, or you trust the writer.”

She cupped her hands like a megaphone and yelled upward. “And nobody trusts *you,* buddy!”

Zureenab stifled a laugh and added, “Seriously. The writer’s about as trustworthy as a software update that says ‘this may take a few minutes’ and then eats your entire weekend.”

Ramirez grinned at her. “See? Cute *and* accurate.”

Rahim exhaled, rubbing his temple. “I don’t like this. I don’t like any of this. But…” His eyes lingered on the signal map. “…if it gets us one step closer to freeing the girls, I don’t see another choice.”

Zureenab spun the laptop back toward herself, her fingers already racing again. “Then let’s start. Because while we sit here doubting, he’s tightening the leash.”

The hum of broken servers filled the silence, but this time, it didn’t feel hopeless.

This time, they had a hacker who believed she could fight fire with fire.

And maybe, just maybe, she was right.

Zureenab paused, then pulled a slim black drive from her pocket, slotting it into Zayra’s laptop with a soft click. “These are the keys. The controls. If the girls attack again, you’ll be the one sending the signals to jam his system.” She looked directly at Zayra, her tone steady. “I built the bones, but you have the mind to wield it. Don’t hesitate when the moment comes.”

Zayra’s fingers brushed the keys, her eyes narrowing with quiet resolve. For the first time since this began, the team had something that felt dangerously close to hope.
