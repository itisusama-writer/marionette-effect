Title: "Chapter 9 - Collapse"

The summons came quietly.

A plain envelope slid under Lena’s apartment door. Another appeared at Aida’s desk while she was away for a few minutes. Both contained the same single line, typed in black ink.

**“You are requested to appear for questioning at Central Police Station, 10:00 a.m.”**

Neither of them slept that night.

Rahim was waiting when they arrived. His voice was polite, but his eyes were sharp. He moved without hurry, offering tea, letting the silence stretch inside the sterile interview room until the air felt heavy.

“You were both near the city square last Thursday,” he began, sliding still frames across the table. “Do you recognize these images?”

Lena’s throat tightened. The photograph was clear enough, her red scarf visible, Aida’s profile blurred but recognizable.

“I walk through there sometimes,” Lena said carefully.

Aida kept her gaze fixed on the table. “I was just passing by.”

Rahim leaned forward. “Passing by at the exact same moment, without speaking, then walking away in opposite directions?”

The tension in the room thickened.

He placed another image on the table. “And about this.”

The photograph was grainier, but it caught the edge of Aida’s trousers lifting slightly as she stepped over a curb. Just enough to reveal the faint metallic curve around her ankle.

Rahim tapped it. “What is that? An electronic tag? A medical device? Some kind of signal tracker?”

Lena’s fingers curled tightly in her lap. Aida’s eyes flicked toward the wall clock. Neither spoke.

Rahim’s tone hardened. “I have seen enough cases to know when someone is not telling me the full story.”

Then it happened.

Lena’s vision blurred and her head swam. Aida’s breath caught in her chest. Within seconds both of them slumped forward, knocking their cups to the floor, the tea spilling across the table.

Rahim shot to his feet, calling for medics as he rushed to their side. Both girls were breathing, their pulses unsteady but present. They were not dead.

Across the city, in the dim light of his study, the man in the bungalow watched their biometric readings on a screen. His fingers tapped the armrest, slow and deliberate.

He had expected this moment. He had prepared for it.

With a few keystrokes, he had made his point clear. They could not be questioned without him deciding when the conversation ended.

He leaned back and allowed himself a small smile. “You really should not pull at the strings, detective.”
