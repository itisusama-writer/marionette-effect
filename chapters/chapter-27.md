Title: "Chapter 27 – The Idea"
---

Ashraf’s footsteps echoed up the stairs, Lena trailing behind him with the faint glow of her bracelet. The door closed with a sharp click of the lock, leaving the basement heavy with silence and the slow creak of the swaying bulb.

For a while, nobody spoke. The ropes dug into their wrists, chairs groaned whenever they shifted, and the air smelled of damp concrete.

Then Ramirez suddenly leaned forward, her eyes flashing with something other than defeat. “Hey, Zureenab… hey. Flip the chair.”

Zureenab twisted her head toward her. “Why? That’s stupid. We’ll just crash on the floor.”

Ramirez smirked. “Because the writer was trying to sleep, and boom, he got an idea. And he wants me to do this. Don’t argue with me, just flip!”

Zureenab groaned. “You’re insane.”

But Ramirez had already rocked her weight sideways, throwing her body until her chair tipped over. She landed hard on the floor with a loud *thud*. “Ow! Okay, that hurt more than I thought.”

Zureenab frowned. “See? Pointless.”

“Not pointless,” Ramirez grunted, wriggling furiously against her ropes. “Now roll your chair next to mine.”

Reluctantly, Zureenab tipped her own chair over, crashing down beside Ramirez.

“Good,” Ramirez said with a crooked grin. “Now—hold still.”

She worked her bound hands against Zureenab’s knots, twisting and tugging despite the awkward angle. After a painful few minutes, the ropes finally loosened. Zureenab’s wrist slipped free.

Zureenab sat up, rubbing her bruised arms. She looked down at Ramirez with exasperation. “You’re ridiculous. But it worked.”

“Of course it worked,” Ramirez said proudly, rolling her eyes toward the ceiling. “The writer never lets me stay tied up for long. He likes me too much.”

Zureenab snorted, then got to work untying Ramirez properly. Together they freed the others one by one, Rahim, Tariq, and finally Zayra.

Rahim flexed his wrists, his voice grim. “We can’t run. If we leave, Ashraf will keep spreading his pawns across IndoPak.”

Zayra nodded, steady and sharp. “We don’t escape. We end this.”

Zureenab’s gaze hardened. “Then it’s decided. We fight.”

Ramirez cracked her knuckles, grinning like a child promised candy. “Finally. Showdown time. And hey, writer—this better be my victory lap.”

The team stood together in the flickering light of the basement, their ropes discarded at their feet.

It was no longer about survival.
It was about ending Ashraf, once and for all.
