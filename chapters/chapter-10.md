Title: "Chapter 10 – Strings Pulled Tighter"

The hospital smelled faintly of antiseptic and sleepless nights. Lena and Aida lay in separate beds, pale but awake, sipping water under the watchful eyes of uniformed officers.

Rahim stood at the foot of Lena’s bed, speaking softly. “I need you to tell me what happened in there. You were fine one moment, then you both went down like a switch had been thrown.”

Lena shook her head slowly. “I… don’t remember.”

He turned to Aida. “You too? Nothing?”

Her gaze dropped to the blanket. “It’s just a blur.”

Rahim’s jaw tightened. He knew what he had seen. No seizure warning, no panic. Just an instant blackout. It was too precise to be coincidence.

The second attempt came two days later. Rahim had arranged a controlled setting, no stress, just casual conversation in the station lounge. He had thought maybe the shock of the first collapse was psychological.

It was not.

The moment he mentioned the ankle devices, both girls went slack in their chairs, cups of tea tipping over again. Their vitals dropped but never crashed, their breathing slow and steady. Medics confirmed there was no physical injury.

The pattern was clear now. Someone was doing this remotely, and whoever it was, they had no fear of being noticed.

Across the city, the man in the bungalow monitored the feeds. He watched their body stats dip and level out, his finger resting lightly on a sleek black console. The “beep” command was almost silent, a simple pulse sent to the bracelets. Not enough to kill, but enough to force compliance without a word spoken.

He sipped his drink, eyes never leaving the screens. The detective was getting closer, but the girls were his wall. Every time Rahim touched the wrong question, the wall dropped, and the conversation ended on his terms.

He liked it that way.

By the end of the week, the tension was starting to seep into the girls’ lives. They could feel the trap closing. Lena caught strangers watching her at a bus stop. Aida noticed a car slowing behind her at night. And both of them now understood something they had not dared admit before.

They were never going to be allowed to talk.

Not to the police. Not to each other. Not without him listening.

And somewhere, they could feel him waiting for the next command to drop.
