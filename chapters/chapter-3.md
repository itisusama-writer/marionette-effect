Title: "Chapter 3 - The Weight on Their Ankles "
---

Lena sat on the edge of her bed, her jeans rolled to her knee. The black band around her ankle felt heavier than it had an hour ago, as if it had settled deeper into her skin. She had tried to slide a butter knife under it, twisting until the metal bent, but the moment the tip touched the inner seam, a sharp sting shot up her leg. It wasn’t just pain—it was the kind of jolt that made her stomach flip and her vision blur.

She dropped the knife.
“What the hell…” she whispered, pulling her blanket over it, as though hiding it would make it less real.

Across the city, Mariam stood in her bathroom, leaning one hand against the counter. She had tried everything—soap, oil, even yanking at the band until her skin burned. Nothing worked. The red light on its side blinked twice, almost like it was mocking her. She caught her own reflection in the mirror and barely recognized the look in her eyes. Fear mixed with something else… curiosity.

Aida was still in her work clothes, pacing her small apartment. She had pressed at the device until her fingertips were numb. It wouldn’t budge. A faint hum vibrated through it, constant and low, like a machine waiting for a signal. She sat down hard on the couch, heart pounding.
She could swear the hum had grown louder.

In a narrow alley behind her building, Hira pulled at hers with both hands, ignoring the pain until it made her gasp. The instant she let go, the red light flicked once. She stepped back, eyes darting to the shadows as if expecting someone to step out. No one did. But the air felt wrong—charged, listening.

In four different places, the same thought crept into their minds, uninvited.

*It’s not just an ankle band.*

And somewhere above the city, in a quiet room with floor-to-ceiling windows, a man sat in a leather chair, watching four small red dots blink steadily on a dark screen. He leaned back, lips curling into the faintest smile.

The game had only begun.
