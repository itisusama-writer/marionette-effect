# **Chapter 16 – The Threat in Her Pocket**

**HQ – Late Night**

The hum of machines was steady, the monitors still glowing faintly with maps and endless scrolling lines of code. Rahim was leaning over Tariq’s shoulder, muttering something about cross-checking data points, when a sharp **ding** broke the rhythm.

Ramirez frowned. She dug into her jacket pocket, pulling out a phone she didn’t even remember owning until now. Sleek, black, screen still warm like it had just been manufactured.

“Oh, perfect,” she muttered. “Thanks, writer. You drop me in the middle of another timeline, forget to give me a decent coffee, but hey at least I get a shiny new phone out of nowhere.”

The screen lit up. One message.

**“We see you. Stop digging, or you’ll collapse like the rest.”**

Ramirez froze.

Then her eyes widened, her voice raising half an octave. “...The fuck is THIS?!” She shoved the phone up for everyone to see, practically shaking it. “Who the hell sends *me* a threat text on a phone I didn’t even know I had five minutes ago?!”

Rahim blinked, confused. “Wait, what do you mean ‘you didn’t know you had’”

“Oh don’t you start!” Ramirez cut him off, pacing in tight circles. “This is the writer again. I swear, he’s in love with torturing girls. Bangles for Minahil, bracelets for these four, and now creepy midnight text messages for *me*.” She jabbed the phone with her finger. “Like seriously, this is harassment by plot device!”

Tariq looked at Rahim, then at Zayra. “...She’s lost it, hasn’t she?”

“Not lost,” Zayra said evenly, already typing furiously on her laptop. “Just... redirected.”

“Redirected into what?” Rahim asked.

Zayra didn’t look up. “Into trying to murder the writer.” She pumped Ramirez.

“DAMN RIGHT I AM!” Ramirez barked, her boots slamming against the floor as she stomped toward the door. “This son of a bitch thinks he can threaten me? I’m gonna find him, drag him out of whatever twisted desk he’s hiding behind, and...”

“Ramirez!” Rahim snapped. “Focus!”

She froze, glaring at him like a wild animal caught in headlights. Then she sighed, dropped the phone onto the table, and muttered, “Fine. But I still hate him.”

The screen was still glowing. The message pulsed faintly, almost like it was alive.

Zayra studied it, her voice calm. “This isn’t just a threat. It’s a signal. He’s piggybacking through the device itself GPS, biometric sensor, the works. He wanted us to know he can see us. All of us.”

Rahim’s jaw tightened. “So he’s watching.”

“And waiting for us to make the wrong move,” Zayra finished.

Ramirez leaned over the table, tapping the glass of the phone with one finger, her face twisted between rage and fear.

“Good,” she growled. “Because when I find him? He’s not getting a warning text back. He’s getting me.”

The room went quiet.

Then Zayra broke it, her tone sharp and steady. “Forget the phone. If he’s watching, we turn that into an advantage. We make him think he’s in control, while we follow the trail back to his core system.”

Rahim nodded slowly. “A counter trap.”

Tariq leaned forward, nervous. “But if he knows we’re baiting him”

“Then we adapt,” Zayra cut in. Her fingers were already flying over her keyboard, rerouting signals. “He’s powerful, but no system is unbreakable. We just have to hit him before he pulls the plug on the girls.”

Ramirez cracked her knuckles, grinning despite the fury still in her eyes. “Finally. Something I can punch.”

Rahim sighed, rubbing his temple. “Please, no punching the servers.”

Ramirez winked. “No promises.”
