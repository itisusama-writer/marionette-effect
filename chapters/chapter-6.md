Title: "Chapter 6 - Shadows from Two Directions"
---

Detective Rahim stood over the open parcel, the faint hum of the small black device filling the air between him and his partner.

“No fingerprints,” his partner muttered. “Cash looks clean too, probably untraceable. And this thing” he pointed to the device “feels like a toy until you notice it’s broadcasting something.”

Rahim’s brow furrowed. “So we’ve got a mystery benefactor delivering… what? A bribe? A warning?”

He tapped the photo taped to the lid. Four young women, their faces hidden in shadow, walking away into the night. It didn’t match any gang drop-off style he’d seen. No drugs, no contraband. Just money and an eerie little gadget.

“Whoever they are,” Rahim said, “they knew exactly where to walk, how to avoid cameras… mostly.” He gestured toward the street camera footage now looping on his tablet. The clip showed the girls crossing the street, keeping perfect distance, not speaking.

Too precise. Too deliberate. And too young.

“They don’t look like criminals,” his partner said. “More like… students. Or office workers.”

Rahim didn’t reply. The gut feeling forming in him was stranger than that. This wasn’t their plan. They were following orders.

That afternoon, the city woke to a viral video. A slick, deep voice filled the frame over shifting black-and-white footage of the girls walking.

“Four. Marked. Tested. Passed.”

The screen cut to a blurry close-up of the ankle devices. Then static. Then text.

*Round two will be harder.*

The video ended with a single line at the bottom: *Watch them closely.*

By evening, the police phones were jammed with calls, half of them with false leads, the other half with sightings of “suspicious women” matching vague descriptions. The news spun wild theories—undercover operatives, political pawns, cult members.

In her apartment, Lena sat at the edge of her bed, ankle throbbing where the device dug into her skin. The news anchor’s voice echoed through the living room.

“…four unidentified women believed to be involved in a mysterious cash drop last night…”

Aida texted her in panic. *They’ve got our faces blurred, but for how long?*

Hira sent another message, her hands shaking as she typed. *I think someone followed me home.*

Mariam didn’t text at all. She just sat staring at the blinking light on her ankle band, wondering if it was the police… or him.

Somewhere across the city, the man in the luxury bungalow poured himself a drink, watching the same news coverage with a thin smile. The police were chasing ghosts. And the girls—his marionettes—were only just learning how tangled the strings really were.
