Title: "Chapter 22 – The Hint of a Trail"

Ramirez sat slouched in the far corner of the operations room, her knees drawn up like a kid sulking after detention. The bruise on her cheek still burned faintly, and every now and then she touched it with a wince.

She tilted her head up toward the ceiling, her voice dropping into a conspiratorial whisper. “See, Mr. U.H… actually I’m proud to be your character. I’m a good girl. Please don’t hurt me. That slap still hurts, you know. You could’ve written me a hug instead. Or a latte. Or a vacation. But nooo, you just love violence, don’t you?”

She pouted at the air, then sighed dramatically. “Fine. But if you *do* decide to throw me into another fight, at least let me win this time. Or give me a puppy. One of the two.”

Across the room, Zayra ignored her, eyes locked on the glowing streams of code running down the screen. The system Zureenab had handed over was alive now, whispering back to her with quiet pulses and data trails. She traced them carefully, narrowing the map from a sea of static into something sharper.

Then she froze.

“There,” she whispered. “Not just the bracelets. The source. A relay point.”

Tariq leaned over her shoulder, wide-eyed. “You mean… where he’s controlling them from?”

“Not the heart,” Zayra replied, her fingers flying faster. “But a vein. Something connected. If we cut through this, it might lead us straight to him.”

Rahim’s jaw tightened as he leaned closer. “Location?”

The screen zoomed in, coordinates snapping into place. A grimy industrial sector near the edge of the city, half-abandoned but still humming with electricity.

Zayra’s voice was steady, but her eyes glinted with purpose. “If we go there, we’re not waiting for him to attack again. We’re hunting him.”

There was a long silence.

Then, from the corner, Ramirez perked up instantly, grin curling across her face. “Hunting?” She hopped to her feet, pointing at the screen like a kid spotting candy. “Now *that* sounds fun. Count me in.”
