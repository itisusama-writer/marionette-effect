Title: "Chapter 7 - Strings in the Sunlight"

The message arrived at exactly 11:45 a.m.

No names, no greeting. Just a map pin and a short command.
*Five minutes. Do not be late.*

Lena’s lunch break had barely started. She glanced at the blinking band under her slacks and felt her stomach twist. Across the city, three other women were checking the same message at the same time.

Aida was in a bookstore, her bag still heavy with unpaid-for paperbacks she was considering buying. She dropped them and walked out without a word.

Hira left her office mid-sentence, ignoring her manager’s questions.

Mariam was already on the street when the notification hit, her steps quickening without thought.

By 11:50, they were each in position, scattered within the bustling city square. The sun beat down, making the air shimmer over concrete. Cars blared horns. Street vendors called out prices. No one looked at the women, yet the air around each of them felt taut, like a string pulled too tight.

Another message came.
*Walk toward the fountain. Collect the blue bag. Do not stop. Do not speak.*

Lena spotted it first—a harmless-looking shopping bag slouched under a bench beside the fountain. She hesitated, then moved. Two other figures moved at the same time from different directions.

Hira reached the bag first, but the instructions didn’t stop there.
*Pass it to the woman in the red scarf. Then keep walking.*

Hira’s eyes flicked up. That was Lena. Their shoulders brushed as the bag changed hands, neither of them daring to meet the other’s gaze fully. The device on their ankles pulsed warm, as if monitoring their obedience.

*Red scarf, hand it to the one in the gray coat.*

Lena’s heart skipped when she saw the woman in the gray coat. Mariam. She knew her by face but not by name, a distant recognition from passing on the same street weeks before.

The bag moved again, smooth and silent. From Mariam’s hands, it disappeared into Aida’s.

*Leave it in the trash bin by the crosswalk. Walk away.*

By the time the bag was gone, they were four strangers again, melting into the crowd. But the sunlight felt sharper now, and each step carried the weight of what they’d just done.

They didn’t know that Detective Rahim was already on the edge of the square, having rushed there on a vague tip from a street informant. He caught a glimpse of two women moving in opposite directions, their pace too purposeful to be casual. He snapped a photo of Lena’s retreating back, then of Aida adjusting her scarf in the distance.

Half an hour later, Rahim stood over the blue bag in the police evidence room. Inside was a small glass case holding a folded note.

*You are not ready for the truth yet.*

Somewhere in his bungalow, the antagonist replayed the security feed from the square, his lips curling upward. Four girls in plain sight, hundreds of witnesses, and not one person realized a crime had taken place.

The game had just entered daylight.
