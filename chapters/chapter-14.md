Title: "Chapter 14 - Shifting Pieces"

The rich man’s fingers hovered above the cracked glass of his monitor. His eyes burned as the screen stabilized, the data streams no longer scrambling under his command.

Impossible.

No one had ever steadied his system like that.

He slammed his palm flat on the desk, the crack spreading further across the display. The hum of his private servers filled the room, stacks of machines lined up like silent soldiers, lights blinking in perfect sync.

“They were supposed to drown in noise,” he whispered, voice trembling with rage. “Instead... they cut through.”

His fortune had bought him invisibility. His network had given him control. And yet somewhere in that operations room—someone had answered him blow for blow.

“Not cops. Not amateurs. Someone else is in the game.”

He leaned back in his chair, watching the static-riddled camera feeds like a gambler staring down a rigged deck. The thought made him both furious and exhilarated.

“Then let’s test their limits.”

He tapped a command.

One of the monitors flickered, showing Lena and Mariam standing blank-eyed in a corridor, waiting. The man smiled, his calm mask returning.

“Go,” he whispered. “Let’s see how long they survive with me watching.”

**Back in the Operations Room – Night**

The monitors were finally stable again. Rahim and Tariq were still reeling, trying to make sense of what had just happened, while Ramirez leaned back in her chair, arms crossed, wearing that smirk that screamed she knew more than she was admitting.

And then—
the door opened.

A girl stepped inside, her presence almost cutting through the exhaustion that hung in the room.

**Zayra.**

Dark waves of hair framed her face, her gold necklace catching the harsh monitor light as if it belonged there. Her eyes held a mix of sharp intelligence and quiet caution, like she was already piecing together a puzzle none of them could see yet.

Rahim turned, frowning. “Who are you?”

Before Zayra could answer, Ramirez whistled low.

“Well, damn. You look quite beautiful,” she said, openly appraising her. Ramirez looked at her like she already knew her. “So the writer decided to use you in this story. Nice... but be careful, babes. He’s crazy.”

Rahim blinked, confused again. “The writer? Are we still on that?”

Ramirez ignored him, leaning forward with a grin. “So, Zayra, right? Welcome to the madhouse. You might want to sit down before this circus gets worse.”

Zayra raised an eyebrow but didn’t flinch. Instead, she stepped closer to the table, her gaze moving from Rahim to Tariq, then finally to the screens still glowing with strange codes.

“If you want me to sit,” she said calmly, “then someone better explain why four college girls are collapsing in perfect unison across the city.”

Rahim froze, exchanging a look with Tariq.

Ramirez’s smirk widened. “Oh, I like her already.”
