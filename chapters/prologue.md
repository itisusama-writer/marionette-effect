Title: "Prologue"

The street was almost empty, the kind of silence that made the city feel like it was holding its breath. Sodium lights buzzed overhead, washing the cracked pavement in sickly orange. It was 2028, but in this corner of the city, it could have been any forgotten year.

Lena and Mariam walked side by side, jackets pulled tight against the night air, plastic takeaway bags swinging from their hands. They spoke in low voices about nothing important, until the sound of tires crunching on gravel made them stop.

A black sedan rolled to the curb without hurry, like it belonged there. Three men stepped out. All wore black jackets, hoods shadowing their faces. They moved with the kind of certainty that made Lena’s stomach clench.

“Keep walking,” Mariam whispered, but their feet betrayed them, slowing, hesitating.

The men closed the distance in seconds. Hands grabbed arms. A sharp chemical smell filled the air as a cloth pressed against girls mouths, but before they could react, a cold click echoed from somewhere below them.

One of the men knelt and fastened something around ther ankle one by one. A sleek, black band that locked into place with a mechanical snap. Mariam’s eyes widened in terror.

“What is...”

The man’s gloved finger pressed against the device, and a faint red light began to pulse.

Lena didn’t have time to scream before the world narrowed to that blinking light.
