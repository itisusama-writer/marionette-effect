Title: "Chapter 1 - Introduction"
---

The city lights of IndoPak shimmered across the wet asphalt, throwing streaks of gold and blue into the night. A deep purr of an imported engine cut through the quiet as a black Maybach eased into the long driveway of a sprawling bungalow. The high gates closed behind it with a slow, deliberate hum.

Inside, the car’s interior smelled faintly of leather and cedar polish. The man in the driver’s seat, immaculately dressed in a dark suit, loosened his tie with one hand as the automatic garage door sealed them from the world outside. His face was calm, expressionless, the face of someone used to having doors open before him and problems vanish when he wanted them gone.

He stepped out, polished shoes clicking against the marble floor. A housekeeper appeared at the far end of the garage, bowing her head slightly.

“Welcome home, sir.”

He gave a polite nod but didn’t answer. The house seemed to breathe around him, its warm lighting and silent hallways wrapping him in a cocoon of wealth.

From the side entrance, three men in black jackets emerged from the shadows. The same men who, an hour earlier, had stepped out of a nondescript sedan on a quiet street.

The one in front spoke, his voice low but carrying enough weight to draw the man’s full attention.
“Boss, those girls… Lena and Mariam. We marked them.”

The man’s fingers brushed his cufflinks, straightening them with an absent precision. “Good,” he said. “Two down.” His tone was smooth, almost casual, but his eyes sharpened. “We still have two more.”

“Yes, sir. We’re tracking them now.”

He started walking toward the main corridor, his footsteps slow, unhurried. “Don’t take too long. The clock is already ticking.”

The men nodded. One of them glanced toward the polished wooden staircase at the end of the hall, but the man never looked back. His mind was already moving ahead, calculating.

Upstairs, a floor-to-ceiling window framed the city skyline, and in its glass reflection, he allowed himself the faintest hint of a smile.

Title: "Chapter 2 - The Next Mark"

The night had thickened into a humid blanket over the city. Traffic had thinned to a few restless motorcycles and the occasional late-night taxi. Somewhere in the maze of narrow streets, a dimly lit café flickered with the sound of its last customers.

Inside, Aida and Hira leaned over the counter, laughing quietly with the barista as they packed away the last of the pastries. The shop smelled of cinnamon and strong coffee, a welcome refuge from the outside air.

“You sure you don’t need a ride?” the barista asked, glancing at the clock.

Hira shook her head. “We’ll be fine. It’s just a ten-minute walk.”

Outside, the men in black jackets waited. Their sedan idled in the shadow of an abandoned building, headlights off. The leader checked his watch, then reached for the earpiece in his right ear.
“They’re moving,” a voice crackled through.

“Visual?” he asked, already scanning the street.

“Confirmed. The one in the white scarf is Aida. The shorter one, Hira.”

A pause, then the man murmured into his mic, “Boss, we’ve got them.”

The reply came after a beat, calm but edged with something cold. “Make it clean. No noise. And remember... they need to walk away thinking they still have a choice.”

The man in the sedan gave a short nod, as though the voice could see him. “Understood.”

Aida pushed the café door open, holding it for Hira, who stepped out into the empty street. The sound of their footsteps echoed, uncomfortably loud. The sedan slid forward, silent, merging with the darkness until it was just another part of the night.

The girls didn’t notice the two figures fall in behind them.

A streetlamp flickered overhead, and in that momentary strobe of light, Hira caught a shadow move at the edge of her vision. She turned, but the street was empty again.

“You okay?” Aida asked.

“Yeah, just... thought I saw someone”

The men were already there. One hand clamped over Hira’s mouth, the other gripping her wrist. Aida tried to scream, but the sound was swallowed by the night as a third figure stepped in, holding the same sleek black device the other girls had received.

It locked around the girls ankles with a metallic click. A faint red light blinked once, twice.

Somewhere far away, in a room lined with glass and city views, the man from the bungalow listened to the faint beeps through his earpiece. He closed his eyes for a moment, as though savoring a step completed in a much larger design.

Title: "Chapter 3 - The Weight on Their Ankles "
---

Lena sat on the edge of her bed, her jeans rolled to her knee. The black band around her ankle felt heavier than it had an hour ago, as if it had settled deeper into her skin. She had tried to slide a butter knife under it, twisting until the metal bent, but the moment the tip touched the inner seam, a sharp sting shot up her leg. It wasn’t just pain—it was the kind of jolt that made her stomach flip and her vision blur.

She dropped the knife.
“What the hell…” she whispered, pulling her blanket over it, as though hiding it would make it less real.

Across the city, Mariam stood in her bathroom, leaning one hand against the counter. She had tried everything—soap, oil, even yanking at the band until her skin burned. Nothing worked. The red light on its side blinked twice, almost like it was mocking her. She caught her own reflection in the mirror and barely recognized the look in her eyes. Fear mixed with something else… curiosity.

Aida was still in her work clothes, pacing her small apartment. She had pressed at the device until her fingertips were numb. It wouldn’t budge. A faint hum vibrated through it, constant and low, like a machine waiting for a signal. She sat down hard on the couch, heart pounding.
She could swear the hum had grown louder.

In a narrow alley behind her building, Hira pulled at hers with both hands, ignoring the pain until it made her gasp. The instant she let go, the red light flicked once. She stepped back, eyes darting to the shadows as if expecting someone to step out. No one did. But the air felt wrong—charged, listening.

In four different places, the same thought crept into their minds, uninvited.

*It’s not just an ankle band.*

And somewhere above the city, in a quiet room with floor-to-ceiling windows, a man sat in a leather chair, watching four small red dots blink steadily on a dark screen. He leaned back, lips curling into the faintest smile.

The game had only begun.

Title: "Chapter 4 – The First Test"

The clock struck 9:00 p.m. across the city.

In her room, Lena was scrolling through her phone when the band around her ankle vibrated sharply. She froze. A second later, her phone screen went black, then flickered to life with a video feed. It showed a city street she didn’t recognize, a convenience store glowing under harsh lights. A voice calm, male, and certain filled her headphones without her pressing anything.

“You have fifteen minutes to be here. Walk. Now.”

Her pulse spiked. “Who is this?” she whispered, but the only reply was another jolt through the band, stronger this time, sharp enough to make her gasp. She grabbed her jacket and stepped out into the night.

Mariam was washing dishes when her band pulsed. Her kitchen light flickered. The same video appeared on her phone, same store, same voice, same demand. She dropped the plate into the sink and backed away, but the next pulse doubled in intensity, buckling her knees. She found herself pulling on her shoes.

Aida was in the middle of a call with her sister when her phone cut to static. The video replaced it instantly. No introduction, just the countdown in the corner of the screen, red numbers ticking away.
“Fifteen minutes,” the voice repeated, “or the next jolt will stop your heart.”

Hira was halfway to bed when she heard the hum in her ankle band grow louder. Her room went silent and her fan, her fridge, even the traffic outside, all sound muted as if the world was holding its breath. Then her phone lit up with the same image the others were seeing.

All four girls moved through the city in different directions, pulled by an invisible thread. None of them knew they were converging on the same spot, but they felt it like a pressure in the air, a whisper in their bones telling them to hurry.

At 9:11, Lena turned the corner and saw the store. She wasn’t alone. Across the street, a figure in a scarf slowed, glancing around. Two others emerged from separate blocks, their eyes wide and wary.

Before any of them could speak, the store’s glass door swung open. A man in a hood stepped out, carrying a small parcel. He dropped it onto the pavement between them. The bands on their ankles began to pulse, steady and unrelenting.

The voice returned, louder now, echoing from somewhere unseen.
“Pick it up. Together. Or you’ll all learn how far my reach goes.”

Inside the dark bungalow miles away, the man in the leather chair watched their every movement through a wall of screens, the corners of his mouth lifting. He didn’t need to see their faces to know the fear had taken root.

Title: "Chapter 5 - The Parcel"
---

The four of them stood frozen in the dim light of the convenience store’s parking lot, the small brown parcel lying between them like a live explosive. The countdown still glowed in red on their phones. Two minutes left.

Lena was the first to move. “We have to open it,” she hissed, glancing over her shoulder.

“No,” Mariam snapped, “he said pick it up, not open it.”

The bands on their ankles buzzed long, slow pulses that made their legs feel heavy. Aida bent down and grabbed one side. The others followed instinctively, lifting it together. The moment it left the ground, the buzzing stopped.

The voice crackled back into their ears, almost casual.
“Good. Now walk. Left, three blocks. There’s a bench. Leave it there.”

They exchanged looks, fear tightening their faces. Hira tried to speak, but the bands buzzed again, sharper this time, cutting her off. So they walked, four strangers bound by the same silent terror.

It wasn’t until they turned the last corner that they saw the problem.

Two police cruisers were parked near the bench, their lights off but engines running. Two officers stood nearby, drinking coffee, watching the empty street.

“Oh my God,” Lena whispered.

“They’ll think it’s ours,” Aida muttered, gripping the parcel tighter.

The countdown ticked under five minutes now. They could hear their own breathing, ragged and uneven.

“What do we do?” Mariam’s voice cracked.

The voice returned, almost mocking this time.
“You’ll leave it. You’ll walk away. If they stop you, you’ll smile and tell them nothing. You’ll do it, because the alternative is... unpleasant.”

The bands buzzed harder, a warning.

They crossed the street. The officers noticed them now, one of them frowning, his gaze dropping to the box in their hands.

“Evening,” he called out. “What’s that you’ve got there?”

The girls didn’t answer. Aida placed the parcel on the bench, her hands trembling. The four turned to leave.

“Hold up,” the officer said, taking a step forward.

The buzzing became a sharp, electric stab. Lena bit her lip to keep from crying out.

“Walk,” the voice ordered.

And they did. Past the police, past the glow of the convenience store, down the empty street. None of them dared to look back.

Behind them, one officer bent to open the box. The other watched the girls vanish into the dark. When the parcel was opened, the contents made his expression shift instantly from curiosity to unease.

A small black device, blinking steadily, sat on top of a stack of crisp, bound cash. And taped inside the lid was a photograph grainy, but clear enough to show four female silhouettes walking away from the camera.

Title: "Chapter 6 - Shadows from Two Directions"
---

Detective Rahim stood over the open parcel, the faint hum of the small black device filling the air between him and his partner.

“No fingerprints,” his partner muttered. “Cash looks clean too, probably untraceable. And this thing” he pointed to the device “feels like a toy until you notice it’s broadcasting something.”

Rahim’s brow furrowed. “So we’ve got a mystery benefactor delivering... what? A bribe? A warning?”

He tapped the photo taped to the lid. Four young women, their faces hidden in shadow, walking away into the night. It didn’t match any gang drop-off style he’d seen. No drugs, no contraband. Just money and an eerie little gadget.

“Whoever they are,” Rahim said, “they knew exactly where to walk, how to avoid cameras... mostly.” He gestured toward the street camera footage now looping on his tablet. The clip showed the girls crossing the street, keeping perfect distance, not speaking.

Too precise. Too deliberate. And too young.

“They don’t look like criminals,” his partner said. “More like... students. Or office workers.”

Rahim didn’t reply. The gut feeling forming in him was stranger than that. This wasn’t their plan. They were following orders.

That afternoon, the city woke to a viral video. A slick, deep voice filled the frame over shifting black-and-white footage of the girls walking.

“Four. Marked. Tested. Passed.”

The screen cut to a blurry close-up of the ankle devices. Then static. Then text.

*Round two will be harder.*

The video ended with a single line at the bottom: *Watch them closely.*

By evening, the police phones were jammed with calls, half of them with false leads, the other half with sightings of “suspicious women” matching vague descriptions. The news spun wild theories—undercover operatives, political pawns, cult members.

In her apartment, Lena sat at the edge of her bed, ankle throbbing where the device dug into her skin. The news anchor’s voice echoed through the living room.

“...four unidentified women believed to be involved in a mysterious cash drop last night.”

Aida texted her in panic. *They’ve got our faces blurred, but for how long?*

Hira sent another message, her hands shaking as she typed. *I think someone followed me home.*

Mariam didn’t text at all. She just sat staring at the blinking light on her ankle band, wondering if it was the police… or him.

Somewhere across the city, the man in the luxury bungalow poured himself a drink, watching the same news coverage with a thin smile. The police were chasing ghosts. And the girls—his marionettes—were only just learning how tangled the strings really were.
