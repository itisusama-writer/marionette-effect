Title: "Chapter 1 - Introduction"
---

The city lights of IndoPak shimmered across the wet asphalt, throwing streaks of gold and blue into the night. A deep purr of an imported engine cut through the quiet as a black Maybach eased into the long driveway of a sprawling bungalow. The high gates closed behind it with a slow, deliberate hum.

Inside, the car’s interior smelled faintly of leather and cedar polish. The man in the driver’s seat, immaculately dressed in a dark suit, loosened his tie with one hand as the automatic garage door sealed them from the world outside. His face was calm, expressionless, the face of someone used to having doors open before him and problems vanish when he wanted them gone.

He stepped out, polished shoes clicking against the marble floor. A housekeeper appeared at the far end of the garage, bowing her head slightly.

“Welcome home, sir.”

He gave a polite nod but didn’t answer. The house seemed to breathe around him, its warm lighting and silent hallways wrapping him in a cocoon of wealth.

From the side entrance, three men in black jackets emerged from the shadows. The same men who, an hour earlier, had stepped out of a nondescript sedan on a quiet street.

The one in front spoke, his voice low but carrying enough weight to draw the man’s full attention.
“Boss, those girls… Lena and Mariam. We marked them.”

The man’s fingers brushed his cufflinks, straightening them with an absent precision. “Good,” he said. “Two down.” His tone was smooth, almost casual, but his eyes sharpened. “We still have two more.”

“Yes, sir. We’re tracking them now.”

He started walking toward the main corridor, his footsteps slow, unhurried. “Don’t take too long. The clock is already ticking.”

The men nodded. One of them glanced toward the polished wooden staircase at the end of the hall, but the man never looked back. His mind was already moving ahead, calculating.

Upstairs, a floor-to-ceiling window framed the city skyline, and in its glass reflection, he allowed himself the faintest hint of a smile.

Title: "Chapter 2 - The Next Mark"
---

The night had thickened into a humid blanket over the city. Traffic had thinned to a few restless motorcycles and the occasional late-night taxi. Somewhere in the maze of narrow streets, a dimly lit café flickered with the sound of its last customers.

Inside, Aida and Hira leaned over the counter, laughing quietly with the barista as they packed away the last of the pastries. The shop smelled of cinnamon and strong coffee, a welcome refuge from the outside air.

“You sure you don’t need a ride?” the barista asked, glancing at the clock.

Hira shook her head. “We’ll be fine. It’s just a ten-minute walk.”

Outside, the men in black jackets waited. Their sedan idled in the shadow of an abandoned building, headlights off. The leader checked his watch, then reached for the earpiece in his right ear.
“They’re moving,” a voice crackled through.

“Visual?” he asked, already scanning the street.

“Confirmed. The one in the white scarf is Aida. The shorter one, Hira.”

A pause, then the man murmured into his mic, “Boss, we’ve got them.”

The reply came after a beat, calm but edged with something cold. “Make it clean. No noise. And remember... they need to walk away thinking they still have a choice.”

The man in the sedan gave a short nod, as though the voice could see him. “Understood.”

Aida pushed the café door open, holding it for Hira, who stepped out into the empty street. The sound of their footsteps echoed, uncomfortably loud. The sedan slid forward, silent, merging with the darkness until it was just another part of the night.

The girls didn’t notice the two figures fall in behind them.

A streetlamp flickered overhead, and in that momentary strobe of light, Hira caught a shadow move at the edge of her vision. She turned, but the street was empty again.

“You okay?” Aida asked.

“Yeah, just... thought I saw someone”

The men were already there. One hand clamped over Hira’s mouth, the other gripping her wrist. Aida tried to scream, but the sound was swallowed by the night as a third figure stepped in, holding the same sleek black device the other girls had received.

It locked around the girls ankles with a metallic click. A faint red light blinked once, twice.

Somewhere far away, in a room lined with glass and city views, the man from the bungalow listened to the faint beeps through his earpiece. He closed his eyes for a moment, as though savoring a step completed in a much larger design.

---
Title: "Chapter 3 - The Weight on Their Ankles "
---

Lena sat on the edge of her bed, her jeans rolled to her knee. The black band around her ankle felt heavier than it had an hour ago, as if it had settled deeper into her skin. She had tried to slide a butter knife under it, twisting until the metal bent, but the moment the tip touched the inner seam, a sharp sting shot up her leg. It wasn’t just pain—it was the kind of jolt that made her stomach flip and her vision blur.

She dropped the knife.
“What the hell…” she whispered, pulling her blanket over it, as though hiding it would make it less real.

Across the city, Mariam stood in her bathroom, leaning one hand against the counter. She had tried everything—soap, oil, even yanking at the band until her skin burned. Nothing worked. The red light on its side blinked twice, almost like it was mocking her. She caught her own reflection in the mirror and barely recognized the look in her eyes. Fear mixed with something else… curiosity.

Aida was still in her work clothes, pacing her small apartment. She had pressed at the device until her fingertips were numb. It wouldn’t budge. A faint hum vibrated through it, constant and low, like a machine waiting for a signal. She sat down hard on the couch, heart pounding.
She could swear the hum had grown louder.

In a narrow alley behind her building, Hira pulled at hers with both hands, ignoring the pain until it made her gasp. The instant she let go, the red light flicked once. She stepped back, eyes darting to the shadows as if expecting someone to step out. No one did. But the air felt wrong—charged, listening.

In four different places, the same thought crept into their minds, uninvited.

*It’s not just an ankle band.*

And somewhere above the city, in a quiet room with floor-to-ceiling windows, a man sat in a leather chair, watching four small red dots blink steadily on a dark screen. He leaned back, lips curling into the faintest smile.

The game had only begun.

---
Title: "Chapter 4 – The First Test"
---

The clock struck 9:00 p.m. across the city.

In her room, Lena was scrolling through her phone when the band around her ankle vibrated sharply. She froze. A second later, her phone screen went black, then flickered to life with a video feed. It showed a city street she didn’t recognize, a convenience store glowing under harsh lights. A voice calm, male, and certain filled her headphones without her pressing anything.

“You have fifteen minutes to be here. Walk. Now.”

Her pulse spiked. “Who is this?” she whispered, but the only reply was another jolt through the band, stronger this time, sharp enough to make her gasp. She grabbed her jacket and stepped out into the night.

Mariam was washing dishes when her band pulsed. Her kitchen light flickered. The same video appeared on her phone, same store, same voice, same demand. She dropped the plate into the sink and backed away, but the next pulse doubled in intensity, buckling her knees. She found herself pulling on her shoes.

Aida was in the middle of a call with her sister when her phone cut to static. The video replaced it instantly. No introduction, just the countdown in the corner of the screen, red numbers ticking away.
“Fifteen minutes,” the voice repeated, “or the next jolt will stop your heart.”

Hira was halfway to bed when she heard the hum in her ankle band grow louder. Her room went silent and her fan, her fridge, even the traffic outside, all sound muted as if the world was holding its breath. Then her phone lit up with the same image the others were seeing.

All four girls moved through the city in different directions, pulled by an invisible thread. None of them knew they were converging on the same spot, but they felt it like a pressure in the air, a whisper in their bones telling them to hurry.

At 9:11, Lena turned the corner and saw the store. She wasn’t alone. Across the street, a figure in a scarf slowed, glancing around. Two others emerged from separate blocks, their eyes wide and wary.

Before any of them could speak, the store’s glass door swung open. A man in a hood stepped out, carrying a small parcel. He dropped it onto the pavement between them. The bands on their ankles began to pulse, steady and unrelenting.

The voice returned, louder now, echoing from somewhere unseen.
“Pick it up. Together. Or you’ll all learn how far my reach goes.”

Inside the dark bungalow miles away, the man in the leather chair watched their every movement through a wall of screens, the corners of his mouth lifting. He didn’t need to see their faces to know the fear had taken root.

---
Title: "Chapter 5 - The Parcel"
---

The four of them stood frozen in the dim light of the convenience store’s parking lot, the small brown parcel lying between them like a live explosive. The countdown still glowed in red on their phones. Two minutes left.

Lena was the first to move. “We have to open it,” she hissed, glancing over her shoulder.

“No,” Mariam snapped, “he said pick it up, not open it.”

The bands on their ankles buzzed long, slow pulses that made their legs feel heavy. Aida bent down and grabbed one side. The others followed instinctively, lifting it together. The moment it left the ground, the buzzing stopped.

The voice crackled back into their ears, almost casual.
“Good. Now walk. Left, three blocks. There’s a bench. Leave it there.”

They exchanged looks, fear tightening their faces. Hira tried to speak, but the bands buzzed again, sharper this time, cutting her off. So they walked, four strangers bound by the same silent terror.

It wasn’t until they turned the last corner that they saw the problem.

Two police cruisers were parked near the bench, their lights off but engines running. Two officers stood nearby, drinking coffee, watching the empty street.

“Oh my God,” Lena whispered.

“They’ll think it’s ours,” Aida muttered, gripping the parcel tighter.

The countdown ticked under five minutes now. They could hear their own breathing, ragged and uneven.

“What do we do?” Mariam’s voice cracked.

The voice returned, almost mocking this time.
“You’ll leave it. You’ll walk away. If they stop you, you’ll smile and tell them nothing. You’ll do it, because the alternative is... unpleasant.”

The bands buzzed harder, a warning.

They crossed the street. The officers noticed them now, one of them frowning, his gaze dropping to the box in their hands.

“Evening,” he called out. “What’s that you’ve got there?”

The girls didn’t answer. Aida placed the parcel on the bench, her hands trembling. The four turned to leave.

“Hold up,” the officer said, taking a step forward.

The buzzing became a sharp, electric stab. Lena bit her lip to keep from crying out.

“Walk,” the voice ordered.

And they did. Past the police, past the glow of the convenience store, down the empty street. None of them dared to look back.

Behind them, one officer bent to open the box. The other watched the girls vanish into the dark. When the parcel was opened, the contents made his expression shift instantly from curiosity to unease.

A small black device, blinking steadily, sat on top of a stack of crisp, bound cash. And taped inside the lid was a photograph grainy, but clear enough to show four female silhouettes walking away from the camera.

---
Title: "Chapter 6 - Shadows from Two Directions"
---

Detective Rahim stood over the open parcel, the faint hum of the small black device filling the air between him and his partner.

“No fingerprints,” his partner muttered. “Cash looks clean too, probably untraceable. And this thing” he pointed to the device “feels like a toy until you notice it’s broadcasting something.”

Rahim’s brow furrowed. “So we’ve got a mystery benefactor delivering... what? A bribe? A warning?”

He tapped the photo taped to the lid. Four young women, their faces hidden in shadow, walking away into the night. It didn’t match any gang drop-off style he’d seen. No drugs, no contraband. Just money and an eerie little gadget.

“Whoever they are,” Rahim said, “they knew exactly where to walk, how to avoid cameras... mostly.” He gestured toward the street camera footage now looping on his tablet. The clip showed the girls crossing the street, keeping perfect distance, not speaking.

Too precise. Too deliberate. And too young.

“They don’t look like criminals,” his partner said. “More like... students. Or office workers.”

Rahim didn’t reply. The gut feeling forming in him was stranger than that. This wasn’t their plan. They were following orders.

That afternoon, the city woke to a viral video. A slick, deep voice filled the frame over shifting black-and-white footage of the girls walking.

“Four. Marked. Tested. Passed.”

The screen cut to a blurry close-up of the ankle devices. Then static. Then text.

*Round two will be harder.*

The video ended with a single line at the bottom: *Watch them closely.*

By evening, the police phones were jammed with calls, half of them with false leads, the other half with sightings of “suspicious women” matching vague descriptions. The news spun wild theories—undercover operatives, political pawns, cult members.

In her apartment, Lena sat at the edge of her bed, ankle throbbing where the device dug into her skin. The news anchor’s voice echoed through the living room.

“...four unidentified women believed to be involved in a mysterious cash drop last night.”

Aida texted her in panic. *They’ve got our faces blurred, but for how long?*

Hira sent another message, her hands shaking as she typed. *I think someone followed me home.*

Mariam didn’t text at all. She just sat staring at the blinking light on her ankle band, wondering if it was the police… or him.

Somewhere across the city, the man in the luxury bungalow poured himself a drink, watching the same news coverage with a thin smile. The police were chasing ghosts. And the girls—his marionettes—were only just learning how tangled the strings really were.

---
Title: "Chapter 7 - Strings in the Sunlight"
---

The message arrived at exactly 11:45 a.m.

No names, no greeting. Just a map pin and a short command.
*Five minutes. Do not be late.*

Lena’s lunch break had barely started. She glanced at the blinking band under her slacks and felt her stomach twist. Across the city, three other women were checking the same message at the same time.

Aida was in a bookstore, her bag still heavy with unpaid-for paperbacks she was considering buying. She dropped them and walked out without a word.

Hira left her office mid-sentence, ignoring her manager’s questions.

Mariam was already on the street when the notification hit, her steps quickening without thought.

By 11:50, they were each in position, scattered within the bustling city square. The sun beat down, making the air shimmer over concrete. Cars blared horns. Street vendors called out prices. No one looked at the women, yet the air around each of them felt taut, like a string pulled too tight.

Another message came.
*Walk toward the fountain. Collect the blue bag. Do not stop. Do not speak.*

Lena spotted it first—a harmless-looking shopping bag slouched under a bench beside the fountain. She hesitated, then moved. Two other figures moved at the same time from different directions.

Hira reached the bag first, but the instructions didn’t stop there.
*Pass it to the woman in the red scarf. Then keep walking.*

Hira’s eyes flicked up. That was Lena. Their shoulders brushed as the bag changed hands, neither of them daring to meet the other’s gaze fully. The device on their ankles pulsed warm, as if monitoring their obedience.

*Red scarf, hand it to the one in the gray coat.*

Lena’s heart skipped when she saw the woman in the gray coat. Mariam. She knew her by face but not by name, a distant recognition from passing on the same street weeks before.

The bag moved again, smooth and silent. From Mariam’s hands, it disappeared into Aida’s.

*Leave it in the trash bin by the crosswalk. Walk away.*

By the time the bag was gone, they were four strangers again, melting into the crowd. But the sunlight felt sharper now, and each step carried the weight of what they’d just done.

They didn’t know that Detective Rahim was already on the edge of the square, having rushed there on a vague tip from a street informant. He caught a glimpse of two women moving in opposite directions, their pace too purposeful to be casual. He snapped a photo of Lena’s retreating back, then of Aida adjusting her scarf in the distance.

Half an hour later, Rahim stood over the blue bag in the police evidence room. Inside was a small glass case holding a folded note.

*You are not ready for the truth yet.*

Somewhere in his bungalow, the antagonist replayed the security feed from the square, his lips curling upward. Four girls in plain sight, hundreds of witnesses, and not one person realized a crime had taken place.

The game had just entered daylight.

---
Title: "Chapter 8 – The First Thread"
---

Detective Rahim sat in the dim operations room, the hum of the surveillance monitors filling the silence. The footage from the city square was grainy but clear enough. Two women brushing past each other by the fountain, one in a red scarf, the other in a gray coat.

He hit pause, leaning forward.

“Same two women, different angles,” said his junior, Tariq, pointing to the next clip on the split screen. “Here, thirty seconds earlier, they both enter from opposite ends of the street. Their timing is too perfect.”

Rahim’s eyes narrowed. “And here, right after... they don’t even look back.”

He tapped the glass, marking both frames. “Run face match on the one in the red scarf. Start there. Find me everything.”

It was the first tangible connection. Two women moving like pieces on a board, coordinated but silent. And Rahim knew from experience that when coincidences lined up this neatly, someone was pulling the strings.

---

At 3:17 PM, all four girls received the same message.
*New task. Urgent. You have twenty minutes.*

This time, there was no subtle exchange in a crowded plaza. No harmless looking bag. The instructions were blunt.

*You will each enter the listed bank branch. At exactly 3:40 PM, trigger the fire alarm. Do not speak to staff. Do not take anything. Walk out.*

Lena stared at the message until the letters blurred. The bank was five blocks from her office. She could feel her pulse in the ankle device.

Aida’s mind spun. How was this still possible in broad daylight without being caught?

Mariam’s hand trembled as she pushed open the glass door to her assigned branch, trying not to meet the eyes of the security guard.

Hira’s breath came fast, shallow. Her branch was already busy with customers when she slipped inside.

At precisely 3:40, all four alarms wailed in unison in four different parts of the city.

Panic followed, staff shouting, customers rushing to the exits, sprinklers releasing cold sprays in two of the locations. The girls did exactly as told, walking out in the chaos, blending into the panicked crowds.

By 4:15, the news cycle was already lit with headlines: **“Coordinated Bank Alarms Across City. No Theft Reported.”**

The police were rattled. Why trigger alarms without a robbery? Why in multiple branches at once? And why were the security cameras, in three of the four cases, just out of focus or conveniently obstructed at the key moments?

In the dark study of his bungalow, the antagonist watched the footage with satisfaction. This was the beginning of public confusion, of law enforcement chasing smoke while he built the fire.

For the girls, though, the realization was colder. They weren’t just part of something strange anymore. They had now committed a public disruption, their faces possibly caught on multiple cameras, with no way to explain why.

And somewhere in a police database, two of them were now tagged together under a single case file.

The first thread had been found, and Rahim was going to pull.

---
Title: "Chapter 9 - Collapse"
---

The summons came quietly.

A plain envelope slid under Lena’s apartment door. Another appeared at Aida’s desk while she was away for a few minutes. Both contained the same single line, typed in black ink.

**“You are requested to appear for questioning at Central Police Station, 10:00 a.m.”**

Neither of them slept that night.

Rahim was waiting when they arrived. His voice was polite, but his eyes were sharp. He moved without hurry, offering tea, letting the silence stretch inside the sterile interview room until the air felt heavy.

“You were both near the city square last Thursday,” he began, sliding still frames across the table. “Do you recognize these images?”

Lena’s throat tightened. The photograph was clear enough, her red scarf visible, Aida’s profile blurred but recognizable.

“I walk through there sometimes,” Lena said carefully.

Aida kept her gaze fixed on the table. “I was just passing by.”

Rahim leaned forward. “Passing by at the exact same moment, without speaking, then walking away in opposite directions?”

The tension in the room thickened.

He placed another image on the table. “And about this.”

The photograph was grainier, but it caught the edge of Aida’s trousers lifting slightly as she stepped over a curb. Just enough to reveal the faint metallic curve around her ankle.

Rahim tapped it. “What is that? An electronic tag? A medical device? Some kind of signal tracker?”

Lena’s fingers curled tightly in her lap. Aida’s eyes flicked toward the wall clock. Neither spoke.

Rahim’s tone hardened. “I have seen enough cases to know when someone is not telling me the full story.”

Then it happened.

Lena’s vision blurred and her head swam. Aida’s breath caught in her chest. Within seconds both of them slumped forward, knocking their cups to the floor, the tea spilling across the table.

Rahim shot to his feet, calling for medics as he rushed to their side. Both girls were breathing, their pulses unsteady but present. They were not dead.

Across the city, in the dim light of his study, the man in the bungalow watched their biometric readings on a screen. His fingers tapped the armrest, slow and deliberate.

He had expected this moment. He had prepared for it.

With a few keystrokes, he had made his point clear. They could not be questioned without him deciding when the conversation ended.

He leaned back and allowed himself a small smile. “You really should not pull at the strings, detective.”

---
Title: "Chapter 10 – Strings Pulled Tighter"
---

The hospital smelled faintly of antiseptic and sleepless nights. Lena and Aida lay in separate beds, pale but awake, sipping water under the watchful eyes of uniformed officers.

Rahim stood at the foot of Lena’s bed, speaking softly. “I need you to tell me what happened in there. You were fine one moment, then you both went down like a switch had been thrown.”

Lena shook her head slowly. “I… don’t remember.”

He turned to Aida. “You too? Nothing?”

Her gaze dropped to the blanket. “It’s just a blur.”

Rahim’s jaw tightened. He knew what he had seen. No seizure warning, no panic. Just an instant blackout. It was too precise to be coincidence.

The second attempt came two days later. Rahim had arranged a controlled setting, no stress, just casual conversation in the station lounge. He had thought maybe the shock of the first collapse was psychological.

It was not.

The moment he mentioned the ankle devices, both girls went slack in their chairs, cups of tea tipping over again. Their vitals dropped but never crashed, their breathing slow and steady. Medics confirmed there was no physical injury.

The pattern was clear now. Someone was doing this remotely, and whoever it was, they had no fear of being noticed.

Across the city, the man in the bungalow monitored the feeds. He watched their body stats dip and level out, his finger resting lightly on a sleek black console. The “beep” command was almost silent, a simple pulse sent to the bracelets. Not enough to kill, but enough to force compliance without a word spoken.

He sipped his drink, eyes never leaving the screens. The detective was getting closer, but the girls were his wall. Every time Rahim touched the wrong question, the wall dropped, and the conversation ended on his terms.

He liked it that way.

By the end of the week, the tension was starting to seep into the girls’ lives. They could feel the trap closing. Lena caught strangers watching her at a bus stop. Aida noticed a car slowing behind her at night. And both of them now understood something they had not dared admit before.

They were never going to be allowed to talk.

Not to the police. Not to each other. Not without him listening.

And somewhere, they could feel him waiting for the next command to drop.
