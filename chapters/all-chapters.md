Title: "Chapter 1 - Introduction"
---

The city lights of IndoPak shimmered across the wet asphalt, throwing streaks of gold and blue into the night. A deep purr of an imported engine cut through the quiet as a black Maybach eased into the long driveway of a sprawling bungalow. The high gates closed behind it with a slow, deliberate hum.

Inside, the car’s interior smelled faintly of leather and cedar polish. The man in the driver’s seat, immaculately dressed in a dark suit, loosened his tie with one hand as the automatic garage door sealed them from the world outside. His face was calm, expressionless, the face of someone used to having doors open before him and problems vanish when he wanted them gone.

He stepped out, polished shoes clicking against the marble floor. A housekeeper appeared at the far end of the garage, bowing her head slightly.

“Welcome home, sir.”

He gave a polite nod but didn’t answer. The house seemed to breathe around him, its warm lighting and silent hallways wrapping him in a cocoon of wealth.

From the side entrance, three men in black jackets emerged from the shadows. The same men who, an hour earlier, had stepped out of a nondescript sedan on a quiet street.

The one in front spoke, his voice low but carrying enough weight to draw the man’s full attention.
“Boss, those girls… Lena and Mariam. We marked them.”

The man’s fingers brushed his cufflinks, straightening them with an absent precision. “Good,” he said. “Two down.” His tone was smooth, almost casual, but his eyes sharpened. “We still have two more.”

“Yes, sir. We’re tracking them now.”

He started walking toward the main corridor, his footsteps slow, unhurried. “Don’t take too long. The clock is already ticking.”

The men nodded. One of them glanced toward the polished wooden staircase at the end of the hall, but the man never looked back. His mind was already moving ahead, calculating.

Upstairs, a floor-to-ceiling window framed the city skyline, and in its glass reflection, he allowed himself the faintest hint of a smile.

Title: "Chapter 2 - The Next Mark"
---

The night had thickened into a humid blanket over the city. Traffic had thinned to a few restless motorcycles and the occasional late-night taxi. Somewhere in the maze of narrow streets, a dimly lit café flickered with the sound of its last customers.

Inside, Aida and Hira leaned over the counter, laughing quietly with the barista as they packed away the last of the pastries. The shop smelled of cinnamon and strong coffee, a welcome refuge from the outside air.

“You sure you don’t need a ride?” the barista asked, glancing at the clock.

Hira shook her head. “We’ll be fine. It’s just a ten-minute walk.”

Outside, the men in black jackets waited. Their sedan idled in the shadow of an abandoned building, headlights off. The leader checked his watch, then reached for the earpiece in his right ear.
“They’re moving,” a voice crackled through.

“Visual?” he asked, already scanning the street.

“Confirmed. The one in the white scarf is Aida. The shorter one, Hira.”

A pause, then the man murmured into his mic, “Boss, we’ve got them.”

The reply came after a beat, calm but edged with something cold. “Make it clean. No noise. And remember... they need to walk away thinking they still have a choice.”

The man in the sedan gave a short nod, as though the voice could see him. “Understood.”

Aida pushed the café door open, holding it for Hira, who stepped out into the empty street. The sound of their footsteps echoed, uncomfortably loud. The sedan slid forward, silent, merging with the darkness until it was just another part of the night.

The girls didn’t notice the two figures fall in behind them.

A streetlamp flickered overhead, and in that momentary strobe of light, Hira caught a shadow move at the edge of her vision. She turned, but the street was empty again.

“You okay?” Aida asked.

“Yeah, just... thought I saw someone”

The men were already there. One hand clamped over Hira’s mouth, the other gripping her wrist. Aida tried to scream, but the sound was swallowed by the night as a third figure stepped in, holding the same sleek black device the other girls had received.

It locked around the girls ankles with a metallic click. A faint red light blinked once, twice.

Somewhere far away, in a room lined with glass and city views, the man from the bungalow listened to the faint beeps through his earpiece. He closed his eyes for a moment, as though savoring a step completed in a much larger design.

---
Title: "Chapter 3 - The Weight on Their Ankles "
---

Lena sat on the edge of her bed, her jeans rolled to her knee. The black band around her ankle felt heavier than it had an hour ago, as if it had settled deeper into her skin. She had tried to slide a butter knife under it, twisting until the metal bent, but the moment the tip touched the inner seam, a sharp sting shot up her leg. It wasn’t just pain—it was the kind of jolt that made her stomach flip and her vision blur.

She dropped the knife.
“What the hell…” she whispered, pulling her blanket over it, as though hiding it would make it less real.

Across the city, Mariam stood in her bathroom, leaning one hand against the counter. She had tried everything—soap, oil, even yanking at the band until her skin burned. Nothing worked. The red light on its side blinked twice, almost like it was mocking her. She caught her own reflection in the mirror and barely recognized the look in her eyes. Fear mixed with something else… curiosity.

Aida was still in her work clothes, pacing her small apartment. She had pressed at the device until her fingertips were numb. It wouldn’t budge. A faint hum vibrated through it, constant and low, like a machine waiting for a signal. She sat down hard on the couch, heart pounding.
She could swear the hum had grown louder.

In a narrow alley behind her building, Hira pulled at hers with both hands, ignoring the pain until it made her gasp. The instant she let go, the red light flicked once. She stepped back, eyes darting to the shadows as if expecting someone to step out. No one did. But the air felt wrong—charged, listening.

In four different places, the same thought crept into their minds, uninvited.

*It’s not just an ankle band.*

And somewhere above the city, in a quiet room with floor-to-ceiling windows, a man sat in a leather chair, watching four small red dots blink steadily on a dark screen. He leaned back, lips curling into the faintest smile.

The game had only begun.

---
Title: "Chapter 4 – The First Test"
---

The clock struck 9:00 p.m. across the city.

In her room, Lena was scrolling through her phone when the band around her ankle vibrated sharply. She froze. A second later, her phone screen went black, then flickered to life with a video feed. It showed a city street she didn’t recognize, a convenience store glowing under harsh lights. A voice calm, male, and certain filled her headphones without her pressing anything.

“You have fifteen minutes to be here. Walk. Now.”

Her pulse spiked. “Who is this?” she whispered, but the only reply was another jolt through the band, stronger this time, sharp enough to make her gasp. She grabbed her jacket and stepped out into the night.

Mariam was washing dishes when her band pulsed. Her kitchen light flickered. The same video appeared on her phone, same store, same voice, same demand. She dropped the plate into the sink and backed away, but the next pulse doubled in intensity, buckling her knees. She found herself pulling on her shoes.

Aida was in the middle of a call with her sister when her phone cut to static. The video replaced it instantly. No introduction, just the countdown in the corner of the screen, red numbers ticking away.
“Fifteen minutes,” the voice repeated, “or the next jolt will stop your heart.”

Hira was halfway to bed when she heard the hum in her ankle band grow louder. Her room went silent and her fan, her fridge, even the traffic outside, all sound muted as if the world was holding its breath. Then her phone lit up with the same image the others were seeing.

All four girls moved through the city in different directions, pulled by an invisible thread. None of them knew they were converging on the same spot, but they felt it like a pressure in the air, a whisper in their bones telling them to hurry.

At 9:11, Lena turned the corner and saw the store. She wasn’t alone. Across the street, a figure in a scarf slowed, glancing around. Two others emerged from separate blocks, their eyes wide and wary.

Before any of them could speak, the store’s glass door swung open. A man in a hood stepped out, carrying a small parcel. He dropped it onto the pavement between them. The bands on their ankles began to pulse, steady and unrelenting.

The voice returned, louder now, echoing from somewhere unseen.
“Pick it up. Together. Or you’ll all learn how far my reach goes.”

Inside the dark bungalow miles away, the man in the leather chair watched their every movement through a wall of screens, the corners of his mouth lifting. He didn’t need to see their faces to know the fear had taken root.

---
Title: "Chapter 5 - The Parcel"
---

The four of them stood frozen in the dim light of the convenience store’s parking lot, the small brown parcel lying between them like a live explosive. The countdown still glowed in red on their phones. Two minutes left.

Lena was the first to move. “We have to open it,” she hissed, glancing over her shoulder.

“No,” Mariam snapped, “he said pick it up, not open it.”

The bands on their ankles buzzed long, slow pulses that made their legs feel heavy. Aida bent down and grabbed one side. The others followed instinctively, lifting it together. The moment it left the ground, the buzzing stopped.

The voice crackled back into their ears, almost casual.
“Good. Now walk. Left, three blocks. There’s a bench. Leave it there.”

They exchanged looks, fear tightening their faces. Hira tried to speak, but the bands buzzed again, sharper this time, cutting her off. So they walked, four strangers bound by the same silent terror.

It wasn’t until they turned the last corner that they saw the problem.

Two police cruisers were parked near the bench, their lights off but engines running. Two officers stood nearby, drinking coffee, watching the empty street.

“Oh my God,” Lena whispered.

“They’ll think it’s ours,” Aida muttered, gripping the parcel tighter.

The countdown ticked under five minutes now. They could hear their own breathing, ragged and uneven.

“What do we do?” Mariam’s voice cracked.

The voice returned, almost mocking this time.
“You’ll leave it. You’ll walk away. If they stop you, you’ll smile and tell them nothing. You’ll do it, because the alternative is... unpleasant.”

The bands buzzed harder, a warning.

They crossed the street. The officers noticed them now, one of them frowning, his gaze dropping to the box in their hands.

“Evening,” he called out. “What’s that you’ve got there?”

The girls didn’t answer. Aida placed the parcel on the bench, her hands trembling. The four turned to leave.

“Hold up,” the officer said, taking a step forward.

The buzzing became a sharp, electric stab. Lena bit her lip to keep from crying out.

“Walk,” the voice ordered.

And they did. Past the police, past the glow of the convenience store, down the empty street. None of them dared to look back.

Behind them, one officer bent to open the box. The other watched the girls vanish into the dark. When the parcel was opened, the contents made his expression shift instantly from curiosity to unease.

A small black device, blinking steadily, sat on top of a stack of crisp, bound cash. And taped inside the lid was a photograph grainy, but clear enough to show four female silhouettes walking away from the camera.

---
Title: "Chapter 6 - Shadows from Two Directions"
---

Detective Rahim stood over the open parcel, the faint hum of the small black device filling the air between him and his partner.

“No fingerprints,” his partner muttered. “Cash looks clean too, probably untraceable. And this thing” he pointed to the device “feels like a toy until you notice it’s broadcasting something.”

Rahim’s brow furrowed. “So we’ve got a mystery benefactor delivering... what? A bribe? A warning?”

He tapped the photo taped to the lid. Four young women, their faces hidden in shadow, walking away into the night. It didn’t match any gang drop-off style he’d seen. No drugs, no contraband. Just money and an eerie little gadget.

“Whoever they are,” Rahim said, “they knew exactly where to walk, how to avoid cameras... mostly.” He gestured toward the street camera footage now looping on his tablet. The clip showed the girls crossing the street, keeping perfect distance, not speaking.

Too precise. Too deliberate. And too young.

“They don’t look like criminals,” his partner said. “More like... students. Or office workers.”

Rahim didn’t reply. The gut feeling forming in him was stranger than that. This wasn’t their plan. They were following orders.

That afternoon, the city woke to a viral video. A slick, deep voice filled the frame over shifting black-and-white footage of the girls walking.

“Four. Marked. Tested. Passed.”

The screen cut to a blurry close-up of the ankle devices. Then static. Then text.

*Round two will be harder.*

The video ended with a single line at the bottom: *Watch them closely.*

By evening, the police phones were jammed with calls, half of them with false leads, the other half with sightings of “suspicious women” matching vague descriptions. The news spun wild theories—undercover operatives, political pawns, cult members.

In her apartment, Lena sat at the edge of her bed, ankle throbbing where the device dug into her skin. The news anchor’s voice echoed through the living room.

“...four unidentified women believed to be involved in a mysterious cash drop last night.”

Aida texted her in panic. *They’ve got our faces blurred, but for how long?*

Hira sent another message, her hands shaking as she typed. *I think someone followed me home.*

Mariam didn’t text at all. She just sat staring at the blinking light on her ankle band, wondering if it was the police… or him.

Somewhere across the city, the man in the luxury bungalow poured himself a drink, watching the same news coverage with a thin smile. The police were chasing ghosts. And the girls—his marionettes—were only just learning how tangled the strings really were.

---
Title: "Chapter 7 - Strings in the Sunlight"
---

The message arrived at exactly 11:45 a.m.

No names, no greeting. Just a map pin and a short command.
*Five minutes. Do not be late.*

Lena’s lunch break had barely started. She glanced at the blinking band under her slacks and felt her stomach twist. Across the city, three other women were checking the same message at the same time.

Aida was in a bookstore, her bag still heavy with unpaid-for paperbacks she was considering buying. She dropped them and walked out without a word.

Hira left her office mid-sentence, ignoring her manager’s questions.

Mariam was already on the street when the notification hit, her steps quickening without thought.

By 11:50, they were each in position, scattered within the bustling city square. The sun beat down, making the air shimmer over concrete. Cars blared horns. Street vendors called out prices. No one looked at the women, yet the air around each of them felt taut, like a string pulled too tight.

Another message came.
*Walk toward the fountain. Collect the blue bag. Do not stop. Do not speak.*

Lena spotted it first—a harmless-looking shopping bag slouched under a bench beside the fountain. She hesitated, then moved. Two other figures moved at the same time from different directions.

Hira reached the bag first, but the instructions didn’t stop there.
*Pass it to the woman in the red scarf. Then keep walking.*

Hira’s eyes flicked up. That was Lena. Their shoulders brushed as the bag changed hands, neither of them daring to meet the other’s gaze fully. The device on their ankles pulsed warm, as if monitoring their obedience.

*Red scarf, hand it to the one in the gray coat.*

Lena’s heart skipped when she saw the woman in the gray coat. Mariam. She knew her by face but not by name, a distant recognition from passing on the same street weeks before.

The bag moved again, smooth and silent. From Mariam’s hands, it disappeared into Aida’s.

*Leave it in the trash bin by the crosswalk. Walk away.*

By the time the bag was gone, they were four strangers again, melting into the crowd. But the sunlight felt sharper now, and each step carried the weight of what they’d just done.

They didn’t know that Detective Rahim was already on the edge of the square, having rushed there on a vague tip from a street informant. He caught a glimpse of two women moving in opposite directions, their pace too purposeful to be casual. He snapped a photo of Lena’s retreating back, then of Aida adjusting her scarf in the distance.

Half an hour later, Rahim stood over the blue bag in the police evidence room. Inside was a small glass case holding a folded note.

*You are not ready for the truth yet.*

Somewhere in his bungalow, the antagonist replayed the security feed from the square, his lips curling upward. Four girls in plain sight, hundreds of witnesses, and not one person realized a crime had taken place.

The game had just entered daylight.

---
Title: "Chapter 8 – The First Thread"
---

Detective Rahim sat in the dim operations room, the hum of the surveillance monitors filling the silence. The footage from the city square was grainy but clear enough. Two women brushing past each other by the fountain, one in a red scarf, the other in a gray coat.

He hit pause, leaning forward.

“Same two women, different angles,” said his junior, Tariq, pointing to the next clip on the split screen. “Here, thirty seconds earlier, they both enter from opposite ends of the street. Their timing is too perfect.”

Rahim’s eyes narrowed. “And here, right after... they don’t even look back.”

He tapped the glass, marking both frames. “Run face match on the one in the red scarf. Start there. Find me everything.”

It was the first tangible connection. Two women moving like pieces on a board, coordinated but silent. And Rahim knew from experience that when coincidences lined up this neatly, someone was pulling the strings.

---

At 3:17 PM, all four girls received the same message.
*New task. Urgent. You have twenty minutes.*

This time, there was no subtle exchange in a crowded plaza. No harmless looking bag. The instructions were blunt.

*You will each enter the listed bank branch. At exactly 3:40 PM, trigger the fire alarm. Do not speak to staff. Do not take anything. Walk out.*

Lena stared at the message until the letters blurred. The bank was five blocks from her office. She could feel her pulse in the ankle device.

Aida’s mind spun. How was this still possible in broad daylight without being caught?

Mariam’s hand trembled as she pushed open the glass door to her assigned branch, trying not to meet the eyes of the security guard.

Hira’s breath came fast, shallow. Her branch was already busy with customers when she slipped inside.

At precisely 3:40, all four alarms wailed in unison in four different parts of the city.

Panic followed, staff shouting, customers rushing to the exits, sprinklers releasing cold sprays in two of the locations. The girls did exactly as told, walking out in the chaos, blending into the panicked crowds.

By 4:15, the news cycle was already lit with headlines: **“Coordinated Bank Alarms Across City. No Theft Reported.”**

The police were rattled. Why trigger alarms without a robbery? Why in multiple branches at once? And why were the security cameras, in three of the four cases, just out of focus or conveniently obstructed at the key moments?

In the dark study of his bungalow, the antagonist watched the footage with satisfaction. This was the beginning of public confusion, of law enforcement chasing smoke while he built the fire.

For the girls, though, the realization was colder. They weren’t just part of something strange anymore. They had now committed a public disruption, their faces possibly caught on multiple cameras, with no way to explain why.

And somewhere in a police database, two of them were now tagged together under a single case file.

The first thread had been found, and Rahim was going to pull.

---
Title: "Chapter 9 - Collapse"
---

The summons came quietly.

A plain envelope slid under Lena’s apartment door. Another appeared at Aida’s desk while she was away for a few minutes. Both contained the same single line, typed in black ink.

**“You are requested to appear for questioning at Central Police Station, 10:00 a.m.”**

Neither of them slept that night.

Rahim was waiting when they arrived. His voice was polite, but his eyes were sharp. He moved without hurry, offering tea, letting the silence stretch inside the sterile interview room until the air felt heavy.

“You were both near the city square last Thursday,” he began, sliding still frames across the table. “Do you recognize these images?”

Lena’s throat tightened. The photograph was clear enough, her red scarf visible, Aida’s profile blurred but recognizable.

“I walk through there sometimes,” Lena said carefully.

Aida kept her gaze fixed on the table. “I was just passing by.”

Rahim leaned forward. “Passing by at the exact same moment, without speaking, then walking away in opposite directions?”

The tension in the room thickened.

He placed another image on the table. “And about this.”

The photograph was grainier, but it caught the edge of Aida’s trousers lifting slightly as she stepped over a curb. Just enough to reveal the faint metallic curve around her ankle.

Rahim tapped it. “What is that? An electronic tag? A medical device? Some kind of signal tracker?”

Lena’s fingers curled tightly in her lap. Aida’s eyes flicked toward the wall clock. Neither spoke.

Rahim’s tone hardened. “I have seen enough cases to know when someone is not telling me the full story.”

Then it happened.

Lena’s vision blurred and her head swam. Aida’s breath caught in her chest. Within seconds both of them slumped forward, knocking their cups to the floor, the tea spilling across the table.

Rahim shot to his feet, calling for medics as he rushed to their side. Both girls were breathing, their pulses unsteady but present. They were not dead.

Across the city, in the dim light of his study, the man in the bungalow watched their biometric readings on a screen. His fingers tapped the armrest, slow and deliberate.

He had expected this moment. He had prepared for it.

With a few keystrokes, he had made his point clear. They could not be questioned without him deciding when the conversation ended.

He leaned back and allowed himself a small smile. “You really should not pull at the strings, detective.”

---
Title: "Chapter 10 – Strings Pulled Tighter"
---

The hospital smelled faintly of antiseptic and sleepless nights. Lena and Aida lay in separate beds, pale but awake, sipping water under the watchful eyes of uniformed officers.

Rahim stood at the foot of Lena’s bed, speaking softly. “I need you to tell me what happened in there. You were fine one moment, then you both went down like a switch had been thrown.”

Lena shook her head slowly. “I… don’t remember.”

He turned to Aida. “You too? Nothing?”

Her gaze dropped to the blanket. “It’s just a blur.”

Rahim’s jaw tightened. He knew what he had seen. No seizure warning, no panic. Just an instant blackout. It was too precise to be coincidence.

The second attempt came two days later. Rahim had arranged a controlled setting, no stress, just casual conversation in the station lounge. He had thought maybe the shock of the first collapse was psychological.

It was not.

The moment he mentioned the ankle devices, both girls went slack in their chairs, cups of tea tipping over again. Their vitals dropped but never crashed, their breathing slow and steady. Medics confirmed there was no physical injury.

The pattern was clear now. Someone was doing this remotely, and whoever it was, they had no fear of being noticed.

Across the city, the man in the bungalow monitored the feeds. He watched their body stats dip and level out, his finger resting lightly on a sleek black console. The “beep” command was almost silent, a simple pulse sent to the bracelets. Not enough to kill, but enough to force compliance without a word spoken.

He sipped his drink, eyes never leaving the screens. The detective was getting closer, but the girls were his wall. Every time Rahim touched the wrong question, the wall dropped, and the conversation ended on his terms.

He liked it that way.

By the end of the week, the tension was starting to seep into the girls’ lives. They could feel the trap closing. Lena caught strangers watching her at a bus stop. Aida noticed a car slowing behind her at night. And both of them now understood something they had not dared admit before.

They were never going to be allowed to talk.

Not to the police. Not to each other. Not without him listening.

And somewhere, they could feel him waiting for the next command to drop.

---
Title: "Chapter 11 - An Unwelcome Drop-In"
---

The police operations room buzzed with low voices and the hum of machines. Monitors flickered with CCTV feeds, biometric readouts, and endless maps of the city. Rahim leaned over Tariq’s shoulder, scanning the latest collapse reports.

“That’s the third time this week,” Tariq said, tapping the screen. “Two of them in broad daylight. Same pattern. Girls go unresponsive, vitals dip, then they just... come back.”

Before Rahim could answer, the air near the evidence table shimmered just for a fraction of a second and a figure landed with a thud on her boots.

“Fuck... not again, you writer,” Ramirez muttered, brushing herself off like she’d been thrown into the scene by an impatient hand. Her tone was somewhere between irritated and resigned.

Tariq blinked. “Uh... who—?”

Ramirez shot him a look. “Don’t ask. Trust me, your head will hurt.” She turned to Rahim, pointing at the files. “These girls Lena, Mariam, Aida, Hira. You’re dealing with a remote trigger system. Somebody’s got biometric control over them, and every time you poke the wrong nerve, boom, they drop.”

Rahim’s brows furrowed. “And you know this how?”

“Let’s just say I’ve seen it before,” Ramirez said, smirking without humor. “Different city, different year... same creepy control fetish.”

She slid into a chair, pulling one of the CCTV feeds toward her. “First step... Stop chasing them like criminals. Whoever’s behind this is using them as shields. You try to corner them, you’ll just trigger another collapse.”

Rahim studied her for a long moment. Something about her didn’t fit, her clothes, her presence, her blunt certainty, but right now, they didn’t have the luxury to question it.

“Fine,” he said finally. “You want in, you work with me and Tariq. But you follow my lead.”

Ramirez gave him a two finger salute. “Sure, Detective. Just remember when this gets ugly, it’s not me you need to worry about. It’s him.”

And in the high-rise bungalow across the city, the man at the console paused mid-sip of his drink. His monitors had just picked up a new variable in his game, a name he didn’t recognize.

He leaned forward, smiling faintly. “Ramirez... Let’s see how you play.”

---
Title: "Chapter 12 - Threads in the Dark"
---

The operations room was quieter now, but the tension clung to the air. The clock on the wall ticked past 11 p.m., and the only light came from the blue glow of the monitors.

Ramirez sat with her boots up on the desk, flipping through digital files faster than Rahim or Tariq could follow. Names, timestamps, incident locations they scrolled across her screen in a rapid blur.

“Okay,” she said, finally lowering her feet. “These collapses? They’re not random. Someone’s tracking their movement *and* their heart rates in real-time. The ankle bracelets aren’t just ornaments they’re biometric cages.”

Rahim crossed his arms. “You’re saying someone is... watching them? Right now?”

“Not just watching. Controlling,” Ramirez replied, tapping a map. “Look, Lena, Mariam, Aida, Hira... every time one of them comes within a certain range of a location... bam. Shutdown signal.”

Tariq leaned in, frowning. “So, they’re programmed to fall if they cross a certain line? That’s... twisted.”

“Yeah, well,” Ramirez muttered under her breath, *“twisted’s basically the writer’s favorite genre.”*

Rahim’s brow furrowed. “Sorry, what was that?”

“Nothing,” she said quickly, flashing an innocent smile. “Just talking to myself. I do that when I’m bored.”

Before Rahim could press further, an alert pinged on the main console. One of the trackers lit up red, then green, then static.

Tariq’s eyes widened. “Uh... that’s not supposed to happen.”

Ramirez leaned forward, her smirk fading. “No, it’s not. Someone’s noticed we’re sniffing around.”

Across the city, in a bunglow filled with the quiet hum of expensive electronics, the rich man behind the bracelets sat at his desk. One monitor showed his girls moving through the streets like shadows. Another displayed an active map of police digital probes.

He reached over, flipped a switch, and spoke into a headset. “Our guests are trying to peek behind the curtain. Let’s make sure they know they’re not welcome.”

Within seconds, the operations room’s screens glitched. Data streams warped. The map scrambled itself into nonsense.

“Son of a...” Ramirez hissed, fingers flying over the keyboard. “He’s throwing us out of his system.”

Rahim glanced at her. “Can you stop him?”

Ramirez leaned closer to the console and whispered to herself, “If you know this writer, I can’t do this bullshit tech stuff. You should’ve sent Zureenab.”

The next instant, her pupils dilated sharply. Her breathing steadied. Her fingers stopped mid-motion. Then resumed with lightning speed, moving across the keyboard like the commands were hardwired into her muscles.

It wasn’t Ramirez’s style anymore.
It was Zureenab’s.

Her body remained in the chair, but her mind had shifted Zureenab was in control, operating through her.

The chaotic streams of code began to align. The scrambled maps reformed. Within seconds, the police systems were not only stable, but enhanced and running faster, sharper, and more secure than before.

Across the city, the rich man froze in front of his monitors. The glitching stopped but now, his feeds were being mirrored. Someone on the other side was watching *him*.

“No... no, no...” he muttered, leaning forward. “That’s impossible.”

Then the mirrored feed zoomed in on his own face.

He slammed his fist on the desk. “WHO THE HELL IS THIS?!”

Back in the operations room, Zureenab, still in Ramirez’s body allowed herself a tiny smirk. “Game on,” she murmured.

Her fingers tapped one last string of code, locking the system with an encryption key only she knew. The feeds stabilized completely, and the antagonist’s access was cut off.

Then she leaned back, exhaled, and muttered, “Alright... your turn, Ramirez.”

Her eyes fluttered shut for a fraction of a second. When they opened again, the sharp precision in her gaze was gone replaced by Ramirez’s usual spark of chaos.

Ramirez blinked, looked down at her hands, and muttered, “...What the hell just happened?”

Rahim and Tariq exchanged confused glances, as if they’d just watched someone switch channels in the middle of a live broadcast.

Ramirez blinked hard, looking from the screen to her own fingers like they’d just betrayed her. “...What the hell just happened?” she muttered.

Rahim stepped closer, arms crossed. “That’s what *I’d* like to know. One minute you’re complaining about not being a tech person, the next you’re running circles around a top-tier cyber-ops network like it’s Sudoku.”

Tariq leaned in too, smirking. “Yeah, you were *way* too good just now. Don’t tell me you’ve been holding out on us.”

Ramirez tilted her head, eyes narrowing slightly. “Or maybe—just maybe—your friendly neighborhood writer decided to play puppet master again.”

Rahim raised an eyebrow. “The *writer*?”

“Yeah,” she said, pointing vaguely upward. “Big invisible sadist who loves tossing me into gunfights, foot chases, collapsing buildings, and now apparently *cyber warfare*. I swear he’s got a wheel he spins labeled ‘What nonsense can we throw at Ramirez today?’”

She leaned back in her chair, smirking darkly. “And you know what else? He *loves* torturing girls. Bangles for Minahil’s story… some other twisted torture thingy for other girls… and now these ankle bracelets. Wow. Real creative theme there, boss.”

Rahim and Tariq exchanged a baffled glance.

Ramirez caught it and grinned wickedly. “Don’t worry, Detective. I’m fine. Just… occasionally aware of my captivity in someone’s bad habit of storytelling.”

She turned back to the console, fingers drumming. “But whoever’s behind those bracelets? He just got spooked. That’s our cue to push harder before he recovers.”

Rahim sighed, still clearly unconvinced about her “writer” rant, but he couldn’t argue with the results. “Fine. What’s our next move?”

Ramirez smirked. “Next move is you and Tariq keep doing your detective thing, and I...” She jabbed a thumb at herself. “... Keep playing the game until the writer gets bored of torturing me.”

Under her breath, she muttered with a sly smile, *“Which, knowing him, is never.”*

Title: "Chapter 14 - Shifting Pieces"
---

The rich man’s fingers hovered above the cracked glass of his monitor. His eyes burned as the screen stabilized, the data streams no longer scrambling under his command.

Impossible.

No one had ever steadied his system like that.

He slammed his palm flat on the desk, the crack spreading further across the display. The hum of his private servers filled the room, stacks of machines lined up like silent soldiers, lights blinking in perfect sync.

“They were supposed to drown in noise,” he whispered, voice trembling with rage. “Instead... they cut through.”

His fortune had bought him invisibility. His network had given him control. And yet somewhere in that operations room—someone had answered him blow for blow.

“Not cops. Not amateurs. Someone else is in the game.”

He leaned back in his chair, watching the static-riddled camera feeds like a gambler staring down a rigged deck. The thought made him both furious and exhilarated.

“Then let’s test their limits.”

He tapped a command.

One of the monitors flickered, showing Lena and Mariam standing blank-eyed in a corridor, waiting. The man smiled, his calm mask returning.

“Go,” he whispered. “Let’s see how long they survive with me watching.”

**Back in the Operations Room – Night**

The monitors were finally stable again. Rahim and Tariq were still reeling, trying to make sense of what had just happened, while Ramirez leaned back in her chair, arms crossed, wearing that smirk that screamed she knew more than she was admitting.

And then—
the door opened.

A girl stepped inside, her presence almost cutting through the exhaustion that hung in the room.

**Zayra.**

Dark waves of hair framed her face, her gold necklace catching the harsh monitor light as if it belonged there. Her eyes held a mix of sharp intelligence and quiet caution, like she was already piecing together a puzzle none of them could see yet.

Rahim turned, frowning. “Who are you?”

Before Zayra could answer, Ramirez whistled low.

“Well, damn. You look quite beautiful,” she said, openly appraising her. Ramirez looked at her like she already knew her. “So the writer decided to use you in this story. Nice... but be careful, babes. He’s crazy.”

Rahim blinked, confused again. “The writer? Are we still on that?”

Ramirez ignored him, leaning forward with a grin. “So, Zayra, right? Welcome to the madhouse. You might want to sit down before this circus gets worse.”

Zayra raised an eyebrow but didn’t flinch. Instead, she stepped closer to the table, her gaze moving from Rahim to Tariq, then finally to the screens still glowing with strange codes.

“If you want me to sit,” she said calmly, “then someone better explain why four college girls are collapsing in perfect unison across the city.”

Rahim froze, exchanging a look with Tariq.

Ramirez’s smirk widened. “Oh, I like her already.”

Title: "Chapter 15 - Pieces on the Board"

**Underground Facility – Night**

The rich man’s private chamber glowed with the hum of servers. Code danced across his screens in jagged green lines, his fingers tapping rhythmically as if he were conducting an orchestra no one else could hear.

On the other side of a one-way glass wall, **Lena, Mariam, Aida, and Hira** stood silently. Their eyes were wide open, but empty. Their posture relaxed, almost delicate, yet their bangled ankles pulsed in eerie synchronization, tiny blue sparks running through the metal like veins of fire.

The man leaned closer to the glass, smiling faintly.

“You four are not just soldiers,” he whispered. “You are signals. Noise. Bait.”

He tapped a command. On one of the screens, a schematic appeared—an intricate network of signals branching across the city. At the heart of it was an overlay the police had intercepted earlier. He chuckled softly.

“They think they cracked my cage. They think they understand the bracelets.”

He pointed to the girls.

“But what they have… is version one. Outdated. Disposable. What I hold now” his smile widened, “... Is evolution.”

The bracelets on the girls’ ankles glowed brighter. Their breathing slowed, then matched each other’s perfectly, a single rhythm drawn from a single source.

The man turned away, satisfied. “Let’s see if Rahim and his new guest survive round two.”

---

**Operations Room – Police HQ**

Screens blinked alive with fresh data. Rahim leaned over the console, Tariq beside him, Ramirez sprawled in her usual half-slouch, boots tapping against the desk.

“Okay, good news,” Tariq announced, scrolling through reports. “The collapse triggers... They’re inactive now. The bracelets we studied? Shut down. No new spikes in the last twenty-four hours.”

Rahim exhaled slowly, relief softening his shoulders. “Finally. Some breathing room.”

Ramirez tilted her head, squinting at the screen. “Or...” she dragged the word out, “...it’s the part in the horror movie where the killer pretends to be dead before jumping out with a chainsaw.”

Tariq blinked. “Do you always...”

“Yes,” she cut him off, smirking.

Before Rahim could intervene, the door opened again. Zayra walked in, her laptop already under her arm, eyes sharp and focused.

Rahim gave her a brief nod of acknowledgment. “Back so soon?”

“Didn’t leave,” Zayra replied evenly, sliding into a chair. “I’ve been running sweeps from the side room. And you’re not going to like what I found.”

She placed her laptop down like a blade being unsheathed, the screen flashing to life with cascading code. Cyber defense and system forensics. Your problem isn’t solved it’s just shifted.”

Ramirez raised a brow, leaning back in her chair. “Back again with that ‘I know everything’ face, huh? Great, just what this circus needed another genius who actually knows what she’s doing.”

Zayra froze, confused for a second. “...Excuse me?”

Rahim sighed. “Don’t mind her. She does that.”

Ramirez grinned, unbothered.

Zayra adjusted her glasses, focusing back on her code. “The system you cracked yesterday? It was a decoy. A fake shell to keep you busy. The bracelets you studied are not the ones active right now.”

Rahim’s relief vanished. “Then what are we dealing with?”

Zayra’s fingers flew across the keyboard, a map blooming on-screen. Four red dots pulsed in sync.

“Version two,” she said flatly. “More advanced. Stronger encryption. And.”

The map zoomed in on a live feed: **Lena, Mariam, Aida, and Hira** walking through a deserted street in perfect unison.

Zayra’s jaw tightened. “he’s already using them as pawns.”

Ramirez’s smirk faded for once. She leaned forward, muttering under her breath. “And the writer just can’t help himself. Bangles, bracelets, chains it’s always some twisted jewelry collection.”

Rahim ignored her this time. His voice was grim. “Then it’s not just about stopping the control. It’s about saving the girls before he burns them out completely.”

The room fell silent except for the hum of machines.

The board had been set.
The pieces were moving.
And the game had only just begun.

# **Chapter 16 – The Threat in Her Pocket**

**HQ – Late Night**

The hum of machines was steady, the monitors still glowing faintly with maps and endless scrolling lines of code. Rahim was leaning over Tariq’s shoulder, muttering something about cross-checking data points, when a sharp **ding** broke the rhythm.

Ramirez frowned. She dug into her jacket pocket, pulling out a phone she didn’t even remember owning until now. Sleek, black, screen still warm like it had just been manufactured.

“Oh, perfect,” she muttered. “Thanks, writer. You drop me in the middle of another timeline, forget to give me a decent coffee, but hey at least I get a shiny new phone out of nowhere.”

The screen lit up. One message.

**“We see you. Stop digging, or you’ll collapse like the rest.”**

Ramirez froze.

Then her eyes widened, her voice raising half an octave. “...The fuck is THIS?!” She shoved the phone up for everyone to see, practically shaking it. “Who the hell sends *me* a threat text on a phone I didn’t even know I had five minutes ago?!”

Rahim blinked, confused. “Wait, what do you mean ‘you didn’t know you had’”

“Oh don’t you start!” Ramirez cut him off, pacing in tight circles. “This is the writer again. I swear, he’s in love with torturing girls. Bangles for Minahil, bracelets for these four, and now creepy midnight text messages for *me*.” She jabbed the phone with her finger. “Like seriously, this is harassment by plot device!”

Tariq looked at Rahim, then at Zayra. “...She’s lost it, hasn’t she?”

“Not lost,” Zayra said evenly, already typing furiously on her laptop. “Just... redirected.”

“Redirected into what?” Rahim asked.

Zayra didn’t look up. “Into trying to murder the writer.” She pumped Ramirez.

“DAMN RIGHT I AM!” Ramirez barked, her boots slamming against the floor as she stomped toward the door. “This son of a bitch thinks he can threaten me? I’m gonna find him, drag him out of whatever twisted desk he’s hiding behind, and...”

“Ramirez!” Rahim snapped. “Focus!”

She froze, glaring at him like a wild animal caught in headlights. Then she sighed, dropped the phone onto the table, and muttered, “Fine. But I still hate him.”

The screen was still glowing. The message pulsed faintly, almost like it was alive.

Zayra studied it, her voice calm. “This isn’t just a threat. It’s a signal. He’s piggybacking through the device itself GPS, biometric sensor, the works. He wanted us to know he can see us. All of us.”

Rahim’s jaw tightened. “So he’s watching.”

“And waiting for us to make the wrong move,” Zayra finished.

Ramirez leaned over the table, tapping the glass of the phone with one finger, her face twisted between rage and fear.

“Good,” she growled. “Because when I find him? He’s not getting a warning text back. He’s getting me.”

The room went quiet.

Then Zayra broke it, her tone sharp and steady. “Forget the phone. If he’s watching, we turn that into an advantage. We make him think he’s in control, while we follow the trail back to his core system.”

Rahim nodded slowly. “A counter trap.”

Tariq leaned forward, nervous. “But if he knows we’re baiting him”

“Then we adapt,” Zayra cut in. Her fingers were already flying over her keyboard, rerouting signals. “He’s powerful, but no system is unbreakable. We just have to hit him before he pulls the plug on the girls.”

Ramirez cracked her knuckles, grinning despite the fury still in her eyes. “Finally. Something I can punch.”

Rahim sighed, rubbing his temple. “Please, no punching the servers.”

Ramirez winked. “No promises.”

Ramirez had gone quiet for once. She sat slouched in the far corner of the operations room, knees pulled up, arms crossed, muttering curses under her breath that were clearly not aimed at the antagonist.

“Stupid writer… sick obsession with torturing girls… first bangles, now ankle bracelets… next it’ll be collars, I swear…” She kicked at the leg of the chair. “And this fucking phone out of nowhere? Real classy. Thanks a lot, jackass.”

Rahim hesitated before walking over, lowering his voice so the others couldn’t hear. “So about that phone thing…” He paused, studying her. “How did you get it?”

Ramirez raised a brow, smirking. “Oh, you know. Magic courier pigeon. Don’t ask stupid questions, Detective.”

Rahim didn’t smile. “And hypothetically asking… this ‘writer’ you keep mentioning. Is there actually one, or are you just being delusional?”

Ramirez’s smirk faltered. For a moment, she looked almost tired. Then she leaned closer, her voice low but sharp.

“I’m not a magician, Rahim. And who the hell would willingly make their life a nightmare? Obviously there’s a writer. Someone pulling the strings. Someone who enjoys watching us crawl through their little hellscape.”

Rahim frowned, studying her face, searching for a crack in the sarcasm. But Ramirez just leaned back again, arms folded, returning to her corner.

“Delusional or not,” she muttered, “you’ll see soon enough.”

The room buzzed with faint static from the monitors, but Rahim didn’t move. He just kept staring at her, unsettled by how certain she sounded.

Title: "Chapter 17 - The Bait"
---

The operations room looked like someone had turned paranoia into a blueprint.

Screens glowed with maps, schematics, and scrolling lines of code. Wires ran across desks in messy tangles, the smell of burnt coffee clinging to the air. Rahim stood over the central display, his jaw set, his eyes heavy.

Zayra typed fast, a dozen windows opening and closing in quick succession. “Alright, if we want him to bite, we need to make it look sloppy. Just enough breadcrumbs to tempt him.”

Tariq glanced up. “Breadcrumbs?”

“Fake signals,” she explained. “Ghost activity. A pattern that screams *weak point,* but isn’t real.”

Ramirez leaned back in her chair, arms crossed, boots tapping on the table. “Translation: we’re catfishing a lunatic with ankle bracelets.”

Zayra smirked. “Pretty much.”

Rahim didn’t laugh. “And when he comes sniffing?”

“We catch him trying to catch us,” Zayra replied, fingers still flying.

Ramirez muttered under her breath, *“The writer really loves this crap. Jewelry guy. What’s next, cursed collars or earings?”*

Tariq shot her a confused look. “What?”

“Nothing,” Ramirez said quickly, flashing a fake smile. “Just making conversation.”

Rahim narrowed his eyes but didn’t press. Not here. Not now. Still, the way she said it like she was talking to someone *else* stuck with him. He tucked it away in silence, a private suspicion he wasn’t ready to share.

On the monitors, the fake signal pulsed alive.

Zayra sat back, satisfied. “There. Let’s see if he takes the bait.”

The room went still, waiting.

And somewhere in the city, a pair of eyes were already watching.

The fake signal blinked steady on the operations room screen, like a heartbeat waiting to be noticed.

Rahim folded his arms. “Now we wait.”

Ramirez sighed loudly. “Cool. Love waiting. Love being bait. This writer really spoils me.” She leaned back farther, chair creaking, muttering curses under her breath that Rahim pretended not to hear.

Zayra ignored her, eyes glued to the monitors. Tariq looked like he wanted to throw up.

And then...

---

**Elsewhere in the city.**

The rich man’s chamber hummed with cold machinery. Rows of monitors flickered in the darkness, his empire mapped out in glowing grids.

And then it appeared.

A new signal.

Pulsing. Vulnerable. Just begging to be touched.

His lips curled into a grin. “Ah... so they think they can dangle a thread in my web.”

He leaned forward, fingers brushing across his controls. For a moment, the light of the monitors cut sharp lines across his face, highlighting the hunger in his eyes.

“Sloppy. Too obvious. But tempting enough to taste.”

He tapped a key, sending a probe across the network. Lines of code rushed like hunting dogs, sniffing for weakness.

For the first time in hours, his blood thrilled. Someone had challenged him.

And if they wanted a game... he’d play.

He activated the command line, his voice low and deliberate.

“Deploy Lena. Mariam. Aida. Hira.”

On another screen, four dots lit up on the city grid. His girls his pieces.

“They think they’re hunters. Let’s remind them who built the cage.”

The monitors glowed brighter as the system responded, the air in the chamber vibrating faintly with signal echoes.

And somewhere, far away, the trap the police thought was theirs... had already become his.

---
Title: "Chapter 18 - Pieces on the Board"
---

The operations room buzzed with static. Lines of code blurred, alarms pinged, and the false signal that Zayra had planted suddenly flared red.

Tariq’s hands flew over his keyboard. “Uh, guys? Something’s wrong. He didn’t just take the bait he hijacked it!”

Before Rahim could respond, the lights flickered. Then, the security feeds came alive with movement.

Four figures.

Lena. Mariam. Aida. Hira.

Their blank eyes glowed faintly in the camera haze, each one wearing the cursed ankle bracelets pulsing in sync. They moved like shadows cutting through the street outside HQ swift, mechanical, unstoppable.

“They’re here,” Zayra whispered.

A loud crash split the silence. A window shattered, shards scattering across the floor. Ramirez spun, instincts kicking in, her gun already drawn.

“Aw, hell no,” she barked. “Not again. Writer, I swear.”

The first to lunge through was Lena, her face pale, movements rigid as a puppet. She charged straight at Ramirez with frightening speed.

Ramirez blocked the hit, shoved her back, but another figure was already on her Mariam, fists swinging like pistons. Ramirez ducked one, caught another across the shoulder, and staggered.

“Goddammit, these kids hit harder than rookies on steroids!” she shouted, driving an elbow into Mariam’s side.

The girl didn’t flinch. Didn’t even blink.

Rahim and Tariq tried to hold the door as Aida and Hira pushed through, their blank stares fixed on the room.

Zayra snapped orders. “Don’t hurt them! They’re not in control!”

Ramirez snarled, tossing Mariam across the table. “Oh, I’ll control them, alright. With my fists!”

Zayra grabbed her arm mid-swing. “They are *young girls,* Ramirez! Are you serious?!”

For a split second, Ramirez froze, fist trembling in the air, eyes blazing with fury and confusion.

The girls advanced again, their bracelets glowing brighter, their bodies jerking like marionettes pulled too tight.

Rahim fired a warning shot into the ceiling. “We need to contain them, not kill them!”

“Contain them?!” Ramirez shouted, shoving Lena back against a wall. “They’re trying to rearrange my face, Detective!”

Zayra crouched by a console, her fingers flying. “I can jam the signal temporarily but I need thirty seconds!”

“Thirty seconds?” Ramirez grunted, ducking under a wild swing. “Lady, I don’t even think we have ten!”

The room was chaos metal clanging, furniture toppling, the sound of young voices grunting under a power that wasn’t their own.

And above it all, Ramirez’s voice roared:

“WHEN I FIND THAT RICH BASTARD I SWEAR I’M GONNA SHOVE HIS BRACELETS UP HIS”

“Ramirez!” Rahim cut her off again, pushing Hira away. “Focus!”

The fight raged on, every second dragging closer to collapse, as the girls innocent pawns in someone else’s game closed in.
