## **Chapter 13 – Sudden Genius**

Ramirez blinked hard, looking from the screen to her own fingers like they’d just betrayed her. “...What the hell just happened?” she muttered.

Rahim stepped closer, arms crossed. “That’s what *I’d* like to know. One minute you’re complaining about not being a tech person, the next you’re running circles around a top-tier cyber-ops network like it’s Sudoku.”

Tariq leaned in too, smirking. “Yeah, you were *way* too good just now. Don’t tell me you’ve been holding out on us.”

Ramirez tilted her head, eyes narrowing slightly. “Or maybe—just maybe—your friendly neighborhood writer decided to play puppet master again.”

Rahim raised an eyebrow. “The *writer*?”

“Yeah,” she said, pointing vaguely upward. “Big invisible sadist who loves tossing me into gunfights, foot chases, collapsing buildings, and now apparently *cyber warfare*. I swear he’s got a wheel he spins labeled ‘What nonsense can we throw at Ramirez today?’”

She leaned back in her chair, smirking darkly. “And you know what else? He *loves* torturing girls. Bangles for Minahil’s story… some other twisted torture thingy for other girls… and now these ankle bracelets. Wow. Real creative theme there, boss.”

Rahim and Tariq exchanged a baffled glance.

Ramirez caught it and grinned wickedly. “Don’t worry, Detective. I’m fine. Just… occasionally aware of my captivity in someone’s bad habit of storytelling.”

She turned back to the console, fingers drumming. “But whoever’s behind those bracelets? He just got spooked. That’s our cue to push harder before he recovers.”

Rahim sighed, still clearly unconvinced about her “writer” rant, but he couldn’t argue with the results. “Fine. What’s our next move?”

Ramirez smirked. “Next move is you and Tariq keep doing your detective thing, and I—” She jabbed a thumb at herself. “—keep playing the game until the writer gets bored of torturing me.”

Under her breath, she muttered with a sly smile, *“Which, knowing him, is never.”*
