Title: "Chapter 2 - The Next Mark"
---

The night had thickened into a humid blanket over the city. Traffic had thinned to a few restless motorcycles and the occasional late-night taxi. Somewhere in the maze of narrow streets, a dimly lit café flickered with the sound of its last customers.

Inside, Aida and Hira leaned over the counter, laughing quietly with the barista as they packed away the last of the pastries. The shop smelled of cinnamon and strong coffee, a welcome refuge from the outside air.

“You sure you don’t need a ride?” the barista asked, glancing at the clock.

Hira shook her head. “We’ll be fine. It’s just a ten-minute walk.”

Outside, the men in black jackets waited. Their sedan idled in the shadow of an abandoned building, headlights off. The leader checked his watch, then reached for the earpiece in his right ear.
“They’re moving,” a voice crackled through.

“Visual?” he asked, already scanning the street.

“Confirmed. The one in the white scarf is Aida. The shorter one, Hira.”

A pause, then the man murmured into his mic, “Boss, we’ve got them.”

The reply came after a beat, calm but edged with something cold. “Make it clean. No noise. And remember... they need to walk away thinking they still have a choice.”

The man in the sedan gave a short nod, as though the voice could see him. “Understood.”

Aida pushed the café door open, holding it for Hira, who stepped out into the empty street. The sound of their footsteps echoed, uncomfortably loud. The sedan slid forward, silent, merging with the darkness until it was just another part of the night.

The girls didn’t notice the two figures fall in behind them.

A streetlamp flickered overhead, and in that momentary strobe of light, Hira caught a shadow move at the edge of her vision. She turned, but the street was empty again.

“You okay?” Aida asked.

“Yeah, just... thought I saw someone”

The men were already there. One hand clamped over Hira’s mouth, the other gripping her wrist. Aida tried to scream, but the sound was swallowed by the night as a third figure stepped in, holding the same sleek black device the other girls had received.

It locked around the girls ankles with a metallic click. A faint red light blinked once, twice.

Somewhere far away, in a room lined with glass and city views, the man from the bungalow listened to the faint beeps through his earpiece. He closed his eyes for a moment, as though savoring a step completed in a much larger design.
