Title: "Chapter 4 – The First Test"

The clock struck 9:00 p.m. across the city.

In her room, Lena was scrolling through her phone when the band around her ankle vibrated sharply. She froze. A second later, her phone screen went black, then flickered to life with a video feed. It showed a city street she didn’t recognize, a convenience store glowing under harsh lights. A voice calm, male, and certain filled her headphones without her pressing anything.

“You have fifteen minutes to be here. Walk. Now.”

Her pulse spiked. “Who is this?” she whispered, but the only reply was another jolt through the band, stronger this time, sharp enough to make her gasp. She grabbed her jacket and stepped out into the night.

Mariam was washing dishes when her band pulsed. Her kitchen light flickered. The same video appeared on her phone, same store, same voice, same demand. She dropped the plate into the sink and backed away, but the next pulse doubled in intensity, buckling her knees. She found herself pulling on her shoes.

Aida was in the middle of a call with her sister when her phone cut to static. The video replaced it instantly. No introduction, just the countdown in the corner of the screen, red numbers ticking away.
“Fifteen minutes,” the voice repeated, “or the next jolt will stop your heart.”

Hira was halfway to bed when she heard the hum in her ankle band grow louder. Her room went silent and her fan, her fridge, even the traffic outside, all sound muted as if the world was holding its breath. Then her phone lit up with the same image the others were seeing.

All four girls moved through the city in different directions, pulled by an invisible thread. None of them knew they were converging on the same spot, but they felt it like a pressure in the air, a whisper in their bones telling them to hurry.

At 9:11, Lena turned the corner and saw the store. She wasn’t alone. Across the street, a figure in a scarf slowed, glancing around. Two others emerged from separate blocks, their eyes wide and wary.

Before any of them could speak, the store’s glass door swung open. A man in a hood stepped out, carrying a small parcel. He dropped it onto the pavement between them. The bands on their ankles began to pulse, steady and unrelenting.

The voice returned, louder now, echoing from somewhere unseen.
“Pick it up. Together. Or you’ll all learn how far my reach goes.”

Inside the dark bungalow miles away, the man in the leather chair watched their every movement through a wall of screens, the corners of his mouth lifting. He didn’t need to see their faces to know the fear had taken root.
