Title: "Chapter 25 – Beneath the Carpet"

The tea had gone untouched, cooling slowly on the table. The man’s smile never faltered, though his eyes glittered with something unreadable.

Rahim gave the faintest nod, and the team began to pull back. Better to leave than sip poison in a spotless stage.

But just as they were about to step away, Zayra froze. Her boot had pressed into the edge of the ornate rug beneath the table, and she felt it... hollow, not solid. She crouched, running her hand along the weave.

“There’s something here,” she whispered. Her fingers found the faint outline of wood beneath. A trapdoor.

Rahim’s gaze sharpened. “We need to check this.”

The moment he spoke, the room shifted. The smiling man moved ever so slightly, his hands still folded politely. The two guards outside stepped in, their shadows stretching across the walls.

Ramirez muttered, “Oh, I hate this part. This is always the part where...”

*Thwip!*

The sound was sharp, like air splitting. A sting struck her shoulder.

She staggered, eyes wide. “...Oh, you’ve got to be kidding me.”

Another shot cracked through the air. Zayra went down. Tariq too. Then Rahim. Zureenab cursed under her breath before she slumped sideways.

The world blurred, and Ramirez’s last words before darkness swallowed her were aimed upward. “Writer… I *hate* you…”

The basement was damp and dim when they woke, the sound of dripping water echoing in the corners. One hanging bulb cast long shadows across the cracked concrete floor.

Each of them sat tied to a wooden chair, wrists bound, ankles fastened. The cords bit into their skin whenever they shifted.

Ramirez was the first to stir, groaning. “Oh great. Chairs. Ropes. Creepy basement. Really, writer? Couldn’t spring for a five-star hotel?” She tugged at the cords. “And seriously, do you *ever* get tired of tying women to things? Bangles, bracelets, chains, chairs... it’s like you’ve got a subscription to Misery Monthly.”

Her voice rose, echoing in the damp room. “I’m filing a complaint! I want dental, health, and hazard pay if I’m going to keep getting in your weird female torture thingy every three chapters!”

Zureenab blinked awake, wincing. “She’s already ranting, isn’t she?”

Rahim tugged uselessly at his ropes. “We need to stay focused. There’s a way out of this.”

Ramirez leaned her head back dramatically, glaring at the ceiling. “Yeah, sure. Focus while some invisible sadist cackles at his keyboard. Admit it, Rahim... you’re not fighting a villain, you’re fighting a *writer.* And trust me, he *loves* basements and weird undetectable places.”

The bulb above flickered once, shadows stretching longer across the walls.

Zureenab shifted in her chair, the rope biting into her wrist. “You know what’s funny? If he’s really up there pulling the strings, then technically, he tied this knot. Which means he’s bad at carpentry, good at theatrics, and probably laughing at me for pointing it out.” She looked at the ceiling, her tone dry. “Congratulations, writer. You’ve turned me into commentary text.”

Ramirez snorted. “Told you. He’s obsessed.”

For the first time since she joined them, Zayra spoke. Her voice was calm, almost unsettling in the stillness. “You both talk too much.” Her eyes flicked between the ropes, the door, and the light bulb overhead. “If we waste time ranting at walls, we’ll miss the chance to catch him when he slips.”

Everyone went quiet for a beat.

Then Ramirez grinned crookedly. “Ohhh, she speaks. And it’s scary-smart. I like her.”

And somewhere in the darkness of the basement, footsteps began to approach.
