Title: "Chapter 23 – The Empty House"
---

The road wound through the dark edges of the industrial sector before spilling into a quieter street, the kind that felt out of place in the chaos of the city. At the end of it sat a white-walled bungalow, its tall gates closed but not unfriendly.

The team slowed as they approached, tension heavy in the car. Rahim was silent, his eyes fixed on the looming house. Zayra’s laptop glowed faintly in her lap, coordinates confirming they were close. Zureenab hummed under her breath, as if typing the tune of invisible code.

And Ramirez…

She was staring at the ground outside her window. “Stop. Stop the car!”

Rahim slammed the brakes. Everyone lurched.

“What the hell, Ramirez?” Rahim snapped.

But Ramirez was already out, boots crunching on the gravel. At her feet, a tiny brown-and-white puppy wagged its tail furiously, stumbling toward her with ears too big for its head.

“Oh my God,” Ramirez gasped, dropping to her knees instantly. “You’re perfect. You’re tiny. You’re fluffy. And you love me already, don’t you?” She scooped the puppy up, burying her face in its fur, giggling like the slap on her cheek had never happened. “I don’t care if the writer is cruel, at least he gave me you. Who’s a good puppy? You are!”

Zureenab leaned against the car, bursting into laughter. “Look at you. The terrifying Ramirez, destroyer of systems, babysitting a dog.”

Ramirez stuck out her tongue. “Jealous. He picked me.” She nuzzled the puppy again.

Zayra shifted uncomfortably, arms crossed. “You are not a child. Grow up. Everyone is watching.”

Ramirez looked up, eyes wide and mock-offended. “Excuse you, Zayra, love has no age limit. And this is true love. Isn’t it, puppy?” The puppy barked happily, as if agreeing.

Even Tariq cracked a smile. But Rahim only sighed, pinching the bridge of his nose. “We’re wasting time.”

Reluctantly, Ramirez set the puppy down. It padded off into the shadows as if it had never been there.

The team reached the bungalow and rang the bell. Two guards in dark uniforms stepped forward immediately, blocking their path. Their hands rested on their holsters, eyes sharp.

Before Rahim could speak, the door opened. A man in his late fifties, neatly dressed, raised a hand calmly. “It’s fine. Let them enter.”

The guards exchanged glances, then stepped aside without a word.

Inside, the air smelled faintly of polished wood and cardamom. The man smiled warmly as he led them in. “Welcome. Please, come.”

Ramirez shoved past him immediately, pointing. “We have to search your house!”

The man only inclined his head. “Of course. Search as you wish.”

Rahim gave him a long, suspicious look before signaling the others. They split up, combing through the rooms. Drawers, closets, basement, even the garage... nothing. Not a wire, not a server, not a trace of the network Zayra had traced here.

When they returned to the living room, the man was already waiting with a tray. He set down steaming cups of tea with gentle precision.

“No trouble at all,” he said with the same calm smile. “You look tired. Please, sit. Have some tea.”

The steam rose slowly from the cups, curling like ghostly fingers into the air.

The house was spotless.
Too spotless.
