Title: "Chapter 28 – Breaking the Script"
---

The thud of chairs crashing had not gone unheard. Heavy boots pounded the floor above them, muffled shouts carried down the stairwell. The guards were coming.

By then, everyone was already untied, ropes scattered across the concrete floor. But Ramirez and Zureenab, instead of bracing for battle, were ranting—loudly.

“I told you!” Ramirez waved her hands wildly, glaring at the ceiling. “Every time I’m in a weird situation, the writer thinks it’s funny to play with me. Again and again. Honestly, this guy’s got issues.”

Zureenab folded her arms and nodded sagely. “Correction: he has a *fetish.* Hurting girls, humiliating them, dangling hope like breadcrumbs. It’s literally his thing.”

Zayra stared at them, incredulous. “You girls are crazy. And who the fuck is this *writer* you keep talking about? Show me.”

Ramirez froze mid-rant, then leaned in close, her tone suddenly sharp. “Hey… babes, listen. He’s not God. But he thinks he is. And he is crazy. He has a fetish for hurting girls. That’s why we’re stuck in this mess.”

Zureenab pointed upward, her voice dry and certain. “Because we’re not free people. We’re characters. Every word we say, every rope, every fight—it’s all scripted.”

Zayra’s jaw tightened. “No. We are not characters.”

Ramirez sighed, her bravado faltering for a heartbeat. “Yeah. I also thought that once.”

The basement door burst open. Guards stormed down the stairs, weapons drawn, faces set in cold focus.

Ramirez’s grin snapped back into place. “Finally! Something I *can* hit.”

Before anyone else could move, she launched forward like a storm. A spinning kick caught the first guard in the jaw. She grabbed another by the wrist, twisted his weapon free, and slammed him against the wall. A third swung at her, but she ducked, elbowed his ribs, and dropped him with a punch that cracked like thunder.

The others froze, stunned by her speed and precision.

Rahim blinked hard. “She fights like a trained operative.”

Zureenab raised an eyebrow. “Or like a writer’s favorite toy finally showing off.”

Ramirez dusted her hands, smirking. “What? Don’t look at me like that. I told you, I’m a good girl.”

The team pushed past the unconscious guards and stormed deeper into the bungalow. At the far end of the basement, Zayra and Zureenab found a steel door. Inside, humming servers and glowing monitors lined the walls of the control room.

“This is it,” Zureenab breathed, her fingers already dancing over the keyboard. Zayra grabbed the cables, yanking them free one by one. Sparks flared, the screens went dark, and with a final keystroke, the signal died.

Every bracelet in Ashraf’s network went silent.
The girls were free.

Cheers almost rose in the room but then Rahim shouted. “He’s gone!”

They turned. The other door was wide open. Ashraf’s footsteps faded into the night above, his laughter faint but clear.

Unlucky.
The snake had slipped away.

Ramirez kicked the doorframe hard, growling. “Damn it! Writer, you better not let him run forever. Next chapter, he’s mine.”

The team stood in the wreckage of Ashraf’s control system, free at last but not victorious.

The battle was over.
The war had just begun.

Ramirez looked at the ceiling, opening her mouth for another rant only for her voice to cut off mid sentence. She blinked, startled, as her outline shimmered faintly.

Zureenab’s eyes widened. “Oh… so this is it, huh? No longer needed?” She gave Zayra a small smile before her form began to fade. “Don’t screw it up without me.”

And then, in a blink, both Ramirez and Zureenab vanished.

The basement was silent, their absence leaving the team hollow and unsettled.

Rahim clenched his fists, staring into the darkness where Ashraf had escaped. “Whatever that writer thing is… we are not done yet.”
