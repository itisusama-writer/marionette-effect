Title: "Chapter 20 – Fallout"
---

The smoke had thinned, but the sting lingered in their throats. Shattered glass glittered like ice across the operations room floor. The screens were fried, showing nothing but static.

Rahim stood in the middle of the wreckage, hands on his hips, his jaw clenched so hard it hurt. He didn’t speak. Not yet. His silence was heavier than the alarms still faintly buzzing in the distance.

“They’re gone,” Tariq croaked, coughing into his sleeve. “All of them. He pulled them out right under our noses.”

Zayra slammed her laptop shut. “No, he didn’t pull them. He *used* them. Like drones. Like...” She swallowed hard. “Like weapons.”

Rahim finally spoke. “Not *like* weapons. They *are* weapons now.” His voice cracked under the weight of the words. “Those bracelets… they’ve stripped the girls of choice. Every swing, every strike, it was his hand, not theirs.”

Silence settled again, raw and jagged.

And then, from the far corner, came a loud groan.

“Ughhhh, here we go,” Ramirez said, dragging herself up from where she’d been sprawled on the floor. Her hair was a mess, her cheek still red from Lena’s slap, her boots scuffed. “Cue the sad detective music. Cue the big speech about how tragic it is. And cue me, realizing for the hundredth time that the writer really does have female torture fetish problem.”

Rahim turned sharply. “This isn’t a joke, Ramirez.”

She raised both hands, grinning. “I know, I know. Four girls turned into walking tasers with a mean right hook. Tragic. But can we just pause for a second and admit something? The writer... yes, *you* up there doesn’t know how to chill. Bracelets, bangles, ankle-beep collars. Like, buddy, pick a theme and stick to it. Otherwise it just looks like you’re raiding the jewelry aisle at some cursed Walmart.”

Zayra blinked. “She’s... talking to the ceiling again.”

Tariq muttered, “I think she’s broken.”

“Broken?!” Ramirez pointed straight upward, her finger stabbing the air. “I’ve been broken since the day this lunatic yanked me into a Nemesis robot thingy in another story arc. And now what? Now I get slapped around by possessed college girls while my only reward is *a random phone I didn’t even order*?” She stomped her boot. “That’s harassment by plot device, and I deserve compensation. Like coffee. Or at least dental insurance.”

Rahim pinched the bridge of his nose. “Ramirez...”

“No, don’t ‘Ramirez’ me, Detective! You don’t get it. I’m not in *your* story. You’re in *his*.” She jabbed upward again. “The big invisible sadist with too much time on his hands. He throws me in whenever he’s bored. And do I get a break? Nope. Do I get a cute romance subplot? Nope. Just endless chaos, broken ribs, and these poor girls being turned into jewelry-powered ninjas.”

Zayra tilted her head. “You... do realize none of that makes logical sense, right?”

Ramirez leaned close, eyes wide and dramatic. “Sweetheart, I stopped making sense three timelines ago. You’ll catch up.”

She spun back toward the ceiling, planting her fists on her hips. “So here’s the deal, Writer. You listening? Good. You think you can keep pulling my strings, keep dangling me in front of brainwashed teenagers and smoke bombs, but guess what? I’m done playing nice. Next time you throw me into your little torture circus, I’m punching *you.*”

She jabbed the air again, her grin sharp and ridiculous. “Yeah, that’s right. Break the fourth wall, baby. Try writing *that* scene without looking over your shoulder.”

For a moment, no one spoke. The static on the broken monitors buzzed like laughter.

Finally, Rahim exhaled, heavy and tired. “Enough. Whoever this writer is in your head, whoever this antagonist is in reality it doesn’t matter. The fact remains: those girls are now weapons. And unless we stop him, unless we find a way to cut the strings, every innocent person in this city is next.”

The weight of his words pressed down on the room.

Ramirez sighed, collapsing into a chair with a flop. “Fine. Save the city. Be noble. I’ll play along. But I’m warning you...” she pointed at the ceiling again, her voice rising. “The minute this turns into collars or chokers, I’m walking.”

Zayra gave her a long look, then smirked faintly. “You say that like you actually have a choice.”

Ramirez laughed, bitter but almost cute. “Exactly, babes. Exactly.”

The hum of broken machines filled the silence again. The smoke was gone, the girls were gone, and only the warning remained.

The game wasn’t just on anymore.
It was personal.

**And then—**

The lights flickered once. The air shimmered, the same impossible ripple they’d seen when Ramirez first arrived. A shape crashed into the floor with a dull *thud.*

Everyone spun.

A young woman straightened, brushing dust off her jacket like falling into police HQ was just a casual habit. Her hair was tied back, her sharp eyes immediately locking onto Zayra.

Rahim’s jaw dropped. “Oh my God. Another one. Who are you?”

Ramirez threw her arms up. “I told you! The writer’s getting crazy. He’s just tossing people in like confetti now!”

The newcomer smiled faintly, ignoring Ramirez. “Oh. So you are the new character.” She tilted her head, studying Zayra closely. “You look exactly like the photo.”

Zayra blinked, completely caught off guard. “What... photo?”

The newcomer extended her hand like it was already decided. “Zureenab. I was sent here to help with the tech thingy. I’ve been in this circus before, inside Ramirez’s head, running the keys. Now I’m here in person.”

Zayra froze, staring at her. Rahim still looked lost. Tariq muttered something that sounded like a prayer.

And Ramirez just slouched deeper in her chair, groaning. “Great. First smoke bombs, now surprise roommates. Writer, if this turns into a crossover episode, I’m filing a complaint.”
