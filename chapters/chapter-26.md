Title: "Chapter 26 – The Ones in the Light"
---

The footsteps echoed against the basement walls, steady and deliberate, like someone who had no need to hurry. The dangling bulb swayed slightly with the vibration, throwing long shadows that crawled across the cracked concrete.

Then he appeared.

The polite man from the bungalow doorway, still smiling with unnerving calm, his hands folded neatly behind his back. His pressed suit was untouched by dust, his silver hair glinting in the sickly yellow light.

But he was not alone. "Come on" He said to the girl.

At his side walked **Lena**. Her movements were stiff but not vacant, her eyes following the team with sharpness, though tension trembled behind them. The ankle bracelet around her leg pulsed faintly, each glow syncing with her breath.

Zayra noticed it instantly. “She’s not empty. She’s aware.”

Lena’s jaw tightened. Her lips parted as if to speak, but the polite man’s hand brushed her shoulder lightly, and she stopped. The bracelet gave a quick flicker, and a shadow of pain crossed her face before she masked it with silence.

“Comfortable?” the man asked pleasantly, as though hosting dinner guests instead of prisoners. “I apologize for the ropes, but you see, trust is a currency I cannot afford.”

Ramirez spat to the side, glaring up at him. “You’re one creepy host, you know that? Tea upstairs, ropes downstairs. What’s next, cookies laced with cyanide?” She rolled her eyes at the ceiling. “Yep, the writer’s loving this. Can practically hear the smug keyboard clicks.”

Zureenab muttered under her breath, studying Lena. “Not mind control… compliance through pain. He isn’t puppeteering her. He’s forcing her to walk the tightrope between choice and suffering.” She tilted her head upward and added dryly, “Naturally, he makes *me* explain this. Thanks a lot.”

The man’s smile never faltered. “Clever. I appreciate cleverness. It makes the game worthwhile.”

Rahim’s voice was iron. “She’s not a piece of your game. She’s a hostage. Let her go.”

The man chuckled softly. “Hostage? No. She is… proof. Proof that my reach is complete.” He placed a hand lightly on Lena’s shoulder again, his touch casual, but the bracelet flared in response. Lena winced, then straightened immediately, her voice low and strained.

“I’m fine,” she said, though her eyes betrayed her. “Don’t… don’t make it worse.”

Zayra’s calm voice cut through the tension. “She’s not proof. She’s a warning.”

The man’s eyes flicked to her, his smile widening just a fraction. “Ah. And the quiet one speaks. How refreshing.”

Ramirez groaned loudly. “Refreshing? What is this, a soda commercial? Nobody talks like that except villains and, well… writers.” She shot a glare upward. “Don’t think I don’t see you showing off your thesaurus up there.”

Lena’s bracelet pulsed brighter, the light reflecting across their faces as the basement seemed to shrink around them. Her eyes darted to the team again, a desperate flicker hidden behind her forced stillness.

The polite man clasped his hands behind his back once more, stepping into the full glow of the bulb. “Search, trapdoors, tea, basement… You’ve danced well, detectives. But this is my house.”

Lena blinked once, slow and deliberate, her breath hitching as though she wanted to speak but dared not. The faintest whisper escaped her lips, “I can’t...”, before the bracelet gave another pulse and silenced her.

And in the dim light, the team finally understood.
She wasn’t gone. She was trapped.

Then Zureenab’s sharp eyes caught something gleaming in his hand. A small black remote, its buttons worn from use. She narrowed her gaze. “That’s it. That’s how you’re holding the leash.”

The man’s smile deepened, as if proud of her deduction. He lifted the remote slightly, not threatening, but displaying it like a prize.

“For the first time, allow me to introduce myself,” he said, his voice calm and steady. “You may call me… **Ashraf.**”

He let the name linger in the air, then tilted the remote in his hand. “I have the power, and I can control anyone. Not just her.” His eyes glinted. “I have my pawns everywhere in IndoPak. Karachi. Lahore. Delhi. Kolkata. Islamabad. Mumbai. Hyderabad. From border towns to capital halls.”

The bulb above flickered as he leaned closer, his voice lowering with deliberate weight. “You see, there is nowhere you can go that is not already mine.”

Lena’s bracelet pulsed in rhythm with his words, a cruel echo of his control.
