Title: "Chapter 19 – The Slap and the Smoke"
---

The operations room was chaos, every corner trembling with the fight. The four girls moved with jerking precision, bracelets glowing like tiny veins of fire.

Ramirez blocked another swing from Mariam, her boots skidding against the tiles. “Writer, I swear” she ducked a punch that whistled past her ear “if this is your idea of entertainment, you need therapy. Real therapy. Not the kind with crystals and herbal tea, I mean padded-room therapy!”

Rahim and Tariq struggled to barricade the door, shouting over the clash of bodies. Zayra hammered at her console, fingers flying. “Hold them! Just hold them, I need ten more seconds to jam the signal!”

“Ten seconds?!” Ramirez barked, grabbing Lena by the shoulders and shoving her back. “Lady, that’s...”

*Crack.*

The sound came before the sting.

Lena’s palm connected with Ramirez’s cheek so hard it echoed. For a split second the entire room seemed to freeze.

Ramirez’s head snapped to the side, her hair whipping with it. When she turned back, her eyes were wide, blazing.

“Oh,” she hissed. “Oh, *no*. You did *not* just slap me.”

She stepped forward, fists tightening, every muscle coiled like a spring.

“I don’t care if you’re brainwashed, possessed, or on some creepy jewelry Wi-Fi,” Ramirez growled, “I am about to beat the...”

“Ramirez!” Zayra’s voice cut through like a blade. She seized Ramirez’s arm before the swing could land. “They’re not in control. Do you hear me? They are not the enemy.”

Ramirez’s eyes darted between Zayra and Lena, still breathing hard. Her fist trembled, veins standing sharp under her skin.

“Then why,” she snapped, jerking her chin at the girls, “do they feel like the writer’s personal slapstick show?!” She spun toward the ceiling, shouting at the air itself. “You hear me, you sadistic bastard?! I’m done being your punching bag!”

The girls advanced again, their faces blank, their movements perfect. Rahim fired another warning shot into the ceiling, shards of plaster snowing down.

Zayra yanked Ramirez back again. “Control yourself, or you’ll kill them.”

Ramirez growled, pulling against her grip, but something in Zayra’s eyes steadied her. She spat on the floor instead, muttering curses too fast to follow.

Then, without warning, the room went white.

A sharp hiss filled the air. Thick smoke billowed from vents and cracks in the wall, flooding the HQ in seconds. Alarms screamed. Rahim shouted for everyone to stay low, but the smoke burned their throats, clawed at their eyes.

Ramirez coughed, waving her hands. “Oh, great. *Smoke bombs now?* Classic villain move! What’s next, writer? Banana peels?!”

Through the haze, faint shadows moved. Four figures, pulled by invisible strings, retreating into the fog. The bracelets on their ankles pulsed one last time, then dimmed as they disappeared.

When the smoke cleared minutes later, the HQ was wrecked. Desks overturned, screens cracked, glass glittering across the floor.

But the girls were gone.

Not one prisoner. Not one lead.

On the central console, a single message blinked across the monitors in bold white text.

**“You cannot cage what was born in chains.”**

Rahim’s jaw clenched as silence fell over the room. Tariq sat slumped against the wall, coughing. Zayra’s hands shook slightly as she typed, trying to find even the faintest trace of the signal.

Ramirez wiped the blood from her lip, glaring up at the ceiling like it was a camera. “Warning received, asshole,” she muttered. “But next time you try this smoke-and-mirrors act, I’ll be the one throwing the match.”

The room was silent except for the hum of the broken machines. The antagonist had made his point.

And HQ had caught no one.
